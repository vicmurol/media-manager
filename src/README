Media Manager is a set of utilities whose main purpose is to prepare Matroska
videos from my personal collection for watching them in my Western Digital TV
Live media player.

To this end, it checks out that supported audio and subtitle tracks exist, in
the first place. Also, unneeded language tracks are removed in order to reduce
the video file sizes, whereas missing ones are added from external files if 
present. Additionally, media files are renamed using a common pattern for
cataloguing purposes.

Additional utilities include a subtitle extractor for backing up subtitles in my
Dropbox directory and a Matroska properties GUI editor.
