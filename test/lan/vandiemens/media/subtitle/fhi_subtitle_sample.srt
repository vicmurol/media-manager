I just think your story
is really interesting,

interview you.

- Really?

This is why you came down here.

No, but you see,
nobody would recognize you

because you'd be in shadow
and your voice would be distorted.

thought I was gonna get some cash.

What kind of chat rooms?

386
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,644
It's a...
It's a support group website.

387

someone out there has all your information.

All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

389

I am gonna clone
your hard drives,

390
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,369
and I'm gonna go through all the
information and the activity

391
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,091
and see if I can figure out
how and when this happened.

Can't you just take the credit card
numbers and run that somehow?

394
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,445
No. This is very necessary.

395
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,607
Because right now
they could have

396
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,364
credit cards in your name,
take loans out.

397
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,851
They could have
your social security number.

398
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,605
They could commit crimes
in your name. Do you understand?

399
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,523
They can sell
this information to 20 more people.

just be the beginning.

and you think
nobody's watching you.

404
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,089
And then they wonder
how in the world

405
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,447
someone got their
social security number.

it take for someone to be interested?

He did it! He's butt naked!

468
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,403
- Oh, my God! What the fuck!
- He actually sent it.

469
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,447
He fucking wrote "love slave"
on his leg with lipstick!

470
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,840
Oh, my God.

471
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,445
That is fucking disgusting.

472
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,480
That's awesome.
It looks like a pink sausage!

473
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,565
This is so...

474
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,406
What, do you feel
sorry for him?

475
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,529
- No.
- Are you in love with him?

476
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,361
No, Frye.

477
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,641
Are you in wuv with him?

478
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,200
- Dude, stop.
- Are you in wuv with little Ben Boyd?

479
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,322
Gross, man!
I can feel your boner!

480
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,244
Okay, what I'd like
to tell people at this point is that...

481
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,489
I am not a marriage counselor.

482
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,211
I don't know what you two
know about each other, and that's okay.

483
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,841
I don't wanna know.
That being said, here's your CD

484
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,242
and a printed overview
of all suspicious activity.

485
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,607
Now, I think some
of your personal information

486
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,766
may have been retrieved with your
communications with fear&loathing.

487
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,040
What?

488
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,366
Who's fear&loathing?

489
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,165
It's just some guy.

490
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,688
He's in the chat room I go to.

491
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,406
All you would have
had to do was click on a link

492
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,922
or open an attachment from
him, and then he would've...

493
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,561
He would've installed
a Trojan virus onto your system.

494
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,326
Now, once he does this, he can do
anything he wants with your computer.

495
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,325
You log on, you punch in your
passwords, it comes up on his screen.

496
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,961
Everything you do, he can see.

497
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,927
He can turn on your camera.
He can watch you.

498
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,880
Who is fear&loathing?
Who's he?

499
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,928
How does he have my password?

500
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,887
Your password is your birthday.

501
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,641
And, Derek, gambling websites
are hacked all the time.

502
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,325
And you're also
corresponding with

503
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,010
the bank regarding
your second mortgage.

504
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,527
Wait, we don't have
a second mortgage.

505
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,571
Yeah.

506
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,401
And you received an e-mail
requesting additional information.

507
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,927
Now, banks would never ask for sensitive
information like that via email.

508
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,844
So, I think that's how he possibly got
your personal account numbers,

509
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,891
your social, your mother's maiden
name and all that other stuff.

510
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,808
Who is this guy?
What's his name?

511
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,531
The name I came up with
is Stephen Schumacher.

512
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,444
He's from Oakdale, PA.

513
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,602
- He told me his name was Finn.
- Yeah.

514
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,764
What I need to do now
is find proof. And then once I do that,

515
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,127
I need to contact the local PD in
Oakdale and bring them into it.

516
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,326
What kind of proof?

517
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,970
Bank receipts,
credit card statements.

518
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,281
If he makes any
large transaction, it could nail him.

519
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,044
All right.
And how long will that take?

520
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,929
Could take three weeks.

521
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,128
Could take three months.

522
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,322
We don't have three months.

523
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,404
The cops couldn't do
shit for us, that's why we hired you.

524
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,682
I understand that,
but it's just not that easy, Derek.

525
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,240
- You have to be patient.
- I'm patient. My bank's not patient.

526
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,845
I understand that,
but these people

527
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,485
use mail drops,
they use PO boxes.

528
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,450
They open an account one day,
they close it the next.

529
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,526
DEREK: Well, if you'll
excuse me, I gotta get back to work.

530
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,887
Don't want to lose my job, too.

531
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,521
I'm sorry you had
to see all this.

532
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,047
No, no, no.
Don't be sorry. It's okay.

533
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,363
I'm sorry to say
that I'm used to it.

534
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,966
Take that.

535
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,889
You been doing this long?

536
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,487
Privately, like 6 years.
I was a cop for 20 years.

537
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,250
Computer crimes unit.

538
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,608
My wife passed away,
so I retired

539
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,768
to spend some more
time with my kid. So.

540
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,851
I'm sorry.

541
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,570
It's gonna be okay.

542
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,088
It's gonna be okay,
I promise you.

543
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,649
It's in there.
He's gonna see everything in there.

544
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,608
I didn't, wasn't
really doing... I just...

545
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,004
NINA: You're just
going to look at me.

546
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,446
Okay.

547
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,885
You're gonna change
my voice for this, right?

548
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,007
NINA: Yeah.

549
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,562
My mom's boyfriend was a drunk.

550
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,480
Rager with a wicked left hook.

551
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,649
So, how did you end up here?

552
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,882
I met this guy at the mall.

553
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,041
He told me he could help me out,
give me a place to stay.

554
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,562
And then I got there and there were other
kids. it was just kind of chill.

555
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,882
He's really not a bad guy.

556
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,128
So, how does it work
in the house?

557
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,405
You know, some people
have built-in cameras on their laptops,

558
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,448
some have just webcams.

559
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,931
All of our stuff
is kinda streamed

560
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,530
through a site
that hosts everything.

561
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,921
And then they kinda,
like, take out a commission, I guess,

562
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,964
then just send us our checks.

563
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,050
I don't know, I mean, the younger you
look, then the more you make.

564
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,044
And what happens
when you outgrow it?

565
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,569
When you get older and you're too
old to bring in enough customers?

566
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,521
Um...

567
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,490
Do you think that
you'll do this forever?

568
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,921
I don't know.
I haven't really...

569
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,322
I haven't really
thought about that.

570
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,451
That's the guy!

571
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,605
Love slave!

572

LYDIA: Ben?

575
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,767
Hey.

576
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,366
You're home so early.
Is everything all right?

577
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,681
Yeah.

578
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,605
No band?

579
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,811
Canceled.

580
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,044
What are you doing?

581
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,491
Homework.

582
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,850
You okay, sweetie?

583
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,366
Yeah. I have a lot
of stuff to do.

584
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,651
All right.

585
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,041
Okay.

586
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,044
Why didn't you tell me money was
so tight with the second mortgage?

587
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,120
You know you'll
have to pick me up

588
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,480
and drop me off
every day, right?

589
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,606
I know.

590
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,046
I read it.
The whole thing.

591
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,643
You told him
everything about us.

592
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,041
I don't know what
you want from me.

593
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,206
You barely even
look at me anymore.

594
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,568
NINA: What time's your bus?

595

Kyle.

596
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,047
People are going to
smell it and come up.

597
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,964
No, we're gonna be fine.
Just loosen up. Here.

598
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,281
No!

599

Come on. One.

600
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,404
I did that whole
interview for you.

And so now I have to
repay you by getting stoned?

Just one hit.

603
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,966
One. I've not smoked
since 11th grade, so...

604
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,524
Just remember that.

605
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,285
I bet you were
a real bad girl back in high school, huh?

606
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,723
Nobody liked me in high school.

607
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,131
Surprising.

608
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,769
- Wow.
(SMOKE ALARM RINGS)

I shut this off, Kyle.

That's loud.

Kyle, would you
fucking help me?

- Yeah, it's loud. Get a towel! Get a towel!
- Okay.

- Ow!

Oh, my God. You really
like bossing people around, don't you?

00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,171
Absolutely not.

Okay, great.

620
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,890
So, have you ever
cried over a pet?

Yes.

941
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,680
it's an opening, we have to go for it.

942
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,367
But, you see, I can't betray
his trust like that. I can't.

943
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,689
Besides, I don't even
know where he lives. I don't know.

944
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:53,364
I don't have a cell phone number.
He uses prepaid cell phones.

945
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,209
- He's not stupid.
- How did you find him?

946
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,806
Well, I was looking into a story
on teen runaways,

947
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,970
and if you Google that,
you get some weird stuff.

948
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,644
So you befriended him.

949
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,364
Did you pay to talk to him?

950
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,331
Or buy him anything?
Give him money?

951
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,408
News organizations
don't pay their sources.

952
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,928
- Is that true, Ms. Dunham?
- Of course that's true.

953
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,083
There's just these charges
on your PayPal account.

954
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,005
The initial payments are

955
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,083
having access, private access,
to talking with the boy.

956
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:34,169
And the additions are
an option the client has to encourage

957
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:38,086
the youth to spend
more time talking to them.

958
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,686
Okay.

959
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,086
So, by way of gifting them...

960
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,810
- "Gifting"?
- So you gave him gifts.

961
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,371
NINA: These weren't
personal gifts.

962
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,811
No, no, I understand.

963
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,167
Why don't we go
have a talk in the other room?

964
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:52,084
No, I can explain myself to her.
It's not a problem.

965
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,607
I just wanna know
what the relationship is with the boy.

966
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,091
Come on. Now, in my office.

967
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,491
I want to understand.
Were you intimate with him?

968
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,766
Did you have sex with him?

969
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,242
RICH: - Don't answer that.
- Nina.

970
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,210
Absolutely not.

971
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,446
RICH: Look, I represent
the interest of the parent company.

972
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,847
If you want to make a First Amendment
case out of this, be my guest,

973
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,320
but you will need another attorney.

974
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,563
As far as I'm concerned,
you need to give them whatever they want.

975
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,166
I would also recommend
that you suspend her immediately.

976
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:23,608
I know that I have to suspend her.
I know that, Rich.

977
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:24,966
That's way too much!

978
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,411
This is not too much, Nina.

979
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:30,281
You crossed a line.
This kid came to your fucking house!

980
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,802
What was I supposed to
do about that, Peter?

981
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,646
He showed up, okay, and I didn't want him
to feel like I had used him.

982
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:40,441
Since when do you care what a source feels
like after you get what you want, huh?

983
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,405
Excuse me. I gotta go.

984
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,728
- Um, how long?
RICH: - What's that?

985
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,207
The suspension?

986
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,401
Well...

987
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:54,044
Until you give those two Federal Agents you
just tried to lie to the info they want.

988
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,208
CINDY: You know what
this reminds of?

989
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,963
Sitting in my Corolla,

990
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,528
waiting for you
outside the barracks,

991
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,489
wondering when you'd come out.

992
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:16,006
It reminds me of sitting
outside this shithole called Al-Qa'im.

993
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,367
Nine guys packed into an LAV.

994
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,684
It was the start of the war,
so we were pretty buttoned up.

995
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,007
I had to pee in water bottles.

996
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,924
And at one point, Gunny Mullin wanted
to stitch up a couple of hadjis

driving back and forth in front of us,

01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,885

Good guy, like, a long torso?

1002
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,685
What is it?

1003
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,360
It's just, you never
talk about this stuff.
