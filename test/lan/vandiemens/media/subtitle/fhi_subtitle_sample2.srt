or a leg was in a different position.

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,566
Then its head was looking up
instead of down.

a completely different room.

...named Annabelle Higgins
had died in this apartment.

She was lonely and took a liking
to my doll.

No, no, it was used as a conduit.

So all these are taken from cases
you've investigated?

243
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,571
That's right. Everything you see
in here is either haunted, cursed...

244
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,684
...or has been used in some kind

or doesn't it worry you...

...to have all these items
right in your home?

That's why we have a priest that comes by
once a month to bless the room.

00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,766
Well, the way I see it is:

252
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,571
It's safer for these things
to be in here than out there.

253
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,529
It's kind of like keeping guns
off the street.

254
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,763
Why not just throw them
in an incinerator? Destroy them.

255

Well, that would only destroy the vessel.

A very powerful demonic
has latched itself onto her.

So when you guys investigate
these hauntings...

264

...how do you stop them
from latching onto you?

can be very dangerous...

...but instead shot her in the arm
and then turned the gun on himself.

Maurice had a very troubled life
with little to live for...

...and not even an exorcist
could bring him back.

550
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,889
Which brings us to the three stages
of demonic activity:

551
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,281
Infestation, oppression and possession.

552
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,805
Now, infestation:

553
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,931
That's the whispering, the footsteps,
the feeling of another presence...

554
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,761
...which ultimately grows
into oppression, the second stage.

555
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,207
Now this is where the victim,
and it's usually the one...

556
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,249
...who's the most
psychologically vulnerable...

557

...is targeted specifically
by an external force.

Breaks the victim down.
Crushes their will.

His name's Rory.
He lives here too.

00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,883
- Hmm.
- But he's always sad.

643
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,087
Why is that?

644
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,040
He won't tell me but I think
something bad happened to him.

645

you know, we never knew who lived here.

653
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:24,371
Well, Lorraine and I both feel that
what your house needs is a cleansing.

654
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,846
An exorcism.

655
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,885
What, exorcism?

656
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,810
I thought that was something
that you do to people.

657

LORRAINE: No, not necessarily, no.

We have to get out of here.

659

I'm afraid that's not gonna help.

661
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,246
Go ahead, hon.

662
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,048
I've been seeing the dark entity
that haunts your house...

<i>...and your land.</i>

664
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,767
I saw it first when I came
through your door.

665
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,127
<i>It was latched to your back.</i>

666
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,690
<i>And then I saw it again with the girls
when we walked into the living room.</i>

667
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,887
And it doesn't matter where you go...

668
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,209
...this dark entity has latched itself
to your family...

669
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,885
...and it's feeding off you.

670

Even if we leave?

671
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,925
Sometimes when you get haunted,
it's like stepping on gum.

you have a lot of spirits in here...

674
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,288
...but this is the one that I'm most
worried about, because it is so hateful.

675
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,010
Okay, so what do we do?
Can we call a priest?

676
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,491
ED: I wish it were that easy.

677
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,645
Performing an exorcism is an archaic
procedure. Requires years of training.

678
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,570
And even then,
I have seen it go horribly wrong.

679
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,241
But before we even get that far,
the church has to authorize it first.

680
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,643
It means we gotta investigate,
gather evidence and provide proof...

681
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,330
...and that's the hard part.

682
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,209
Have your children been baptized?

683
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,684
Uh, no, we never got around to that.
We're not really a churchgoing family.

684
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,527
Well, you may want to rethink that.
Our presence here could make things worse.

685
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,806
Why?

686
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,325
Because we're a threat.

687
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,410
And whatever you're dealing with here
isn't gonna like us.

So far it hasn't done anything violent,
and that's a good sign.

689
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,210
So we're gonna have our guy
do some homework on the property...

we'll always be together.

- Lots.

going through what they are.

714
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,763
That's the original farmhouse.

715
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,003
It was built in 1863 by a man
named Jedson Sherman...

716
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,766
...who was married to a woman
named Bathsheba.

717
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,203
Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Estye.

718
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,561
She was one of the women
accused of witchcraft in Salem.

719
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,603
- She was hung during the trials.
- Wow.

720
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,650
After Bathsheba married Jedson,
they had a baby...

721
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,649
...and when the baby was 7 days old...

722
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,730
...Jedson caught her sacrificing it
in front of the fireplace.

723
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,962
She ran out to that tree by the dock...

724
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,282
...climbed up, proclaimed her love
to Satan...

725
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,331
...cursed anyone who tried
to take her land, and hung herself.

726
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,767
Time of death was pronounced at 3:07
in the morning.

727
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,884

She lived there in the '30s.

730
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,329
She had a boy named Rory who
mysteriously disappeared in the woods.

731

Then she killed herself in the cellar.
