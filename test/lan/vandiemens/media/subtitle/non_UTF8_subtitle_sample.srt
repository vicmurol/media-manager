1
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,473
I'm really excited to be here.

2
00:02:07,432 --> 00:02:11,395
We have something really special
to share with you today.

3
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:16,066
In total, between iMac
and PowerBook lines,

4
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:20,404
we have sold over three
million units this year.

5
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:27,120
Okay. That's it.

6
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:30,498
Well, maybe there's
one more thing.

7
00:02:31,374 --> 00:02:34,377
I'm about to show you
something that's amazing.

8
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:39,132
Something that no one else
in the world has seen yet.

9
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:42,759
Now, Jony, myself
and a small team

10
00:02:43,343 --> 00:02:47,431
have been working really
hard on a secret project,

11
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:49,433
which is something
I've been known to do

12
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:51,351
from time to time.

13
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,731
The device I'm about
to introduce to you

14
00:02:54,814 --> 00:02:57,984
is gonna revolutionize
an entire industry.

15
00:02:59,152 --> 00:03:00,945
It's a music playing device.

16
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:02,905
Okay.

17
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:05,074
We'll get to that in a minute.

18
00:03:05,616 --> 00:03:09,954
Because what it represents is
as important as what it is.

19
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:15,084
It's a tool for the heart.

20
00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:20,256
And when you can
touch someone's heart,

21
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:22,967
that's limitless.

22
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,431
If I do say so myself,
it's insanely cool.

23
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:31,643
It's a music player.

24
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:38,317
It's a thousand songs
in your pocket.

25
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:45,616
I'd like to introduce you

26
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,994
to the iPod.

27
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,204
Hey, Jobs.

28
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,289
Get up, man. Wake up.

29
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,668
I'm up.

30
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,048
I'm up.

31
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:49,222
I'm up.

32
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,072
Steve.

33
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:07,408
Hey, Daniel.
Hey, what's going on?

34
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,118
Are you reading Be Here Now?
Yeah, it's amazing.

35
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:11,995
I'm reading that right now.
It's unbelievable.

36
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,330
It's the next level.
Hey, speaking of Be Here,

37
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,416
what happened to you last night?
Where'd you go?

38
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,918
I had to study.
I know, I know.

39
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:22,172
You know, I'm not dismissing
the value of higher education,

40
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,382
I'm just saying it comes at
the expense of experience..

41
00:05:24,465 --> 00:05:26,509
The system can only
produce the system.

42
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,595
I don't want to be a part of that.
Neither should you.

43
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:31,514
I agree with you. It takes balls
to drop out like you did.

44
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,183
That's why you should.

45
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,185
I mean...
Steven.

46
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:37,813
Might I borrow
you for a moment?

47
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:40,024
I'll see you in, see you later.
Sure.

48
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,109
Thank you. Thanks. I hope
I'm not interrupting.

49
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:44,278
What about your classes?

50
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:46,030
I'm not a student
anymore, Jack.

51
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:47,865
Well, you're here,
and you're learning.

52
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,617
Sure sounds like
a student to me.

53
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:51,535
If you want me gone...

54
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:53,370
Why would I want
you gone, Steven?

55
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,206
I'm glad that
you're here.

56
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,957
Whether you're
paying or not.

57
00:05:57,374 --> 00:05:59,043
Now, you're always carrying
this notebook around.

58
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,587
You obviously fancy
yourself as an artist.

59
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,048
Why don't you sit in
on some design classes?

60
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:08,470
No. Well, I like the idea of art, the
beauty. But only in the right context.

61
00:06:08,553 --> 00:06:10,597
Just not as a career. I don't
have the necessary talents.

62
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,766
But aren't you interested in electronics?
What about engineering?

63
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:16,561
There's a growing market for qualified
technicians. What about that?

64
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:18,271
I don't want to spend
my parents' money

65
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:19,940
to get a degree
and become something

66
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:21,358
as forgettable
as an electrician.

67
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:24,526
Excuse me, what, a degree is
a waste of time now? So...

68
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:30,282
For some. For others it offers validation.
Job security.

69
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,159
Steve...
I'll see you around.

70
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:36,705
Steven. To be continued.

71
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,927
What are you working on?

72
00:06:50,262 --> 00:06:54,015
Nothing, really. It's homework
for calligraphy class.

73
00:06:55,183 --> 00:06:56,184
It's beautiful.

74
00:06:58,103 --> 00:07:00,021
Yeah, the teacher's
this monk, or something.

75
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:02,232
A monk?

76
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:04,442
Yeah. Robert Palladino.

77
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:06,861
He's totally inspiring.

78
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:09,698
My name's Julie.

79
00:07:17,206 --> 00:07:18,374
Are you leaving?

80
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,709
Yeah. I have to go.

81
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,631
You want a hit?

82
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:28,050
Yes.

83
00:07:29,844 --> 00:07:31,220
Yes, I do.

84
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:34,890
Can I take a couple?

85
00:07:34,974 --> 00:07:36,934
Sure.
For my friends.

86
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:40,895
Well, my friend,
and my girlfriend.

87
00:07:49,947 --> 00:07:51,907
It's so beautiful.

88
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,078
Like a window to the world.

89
00:07:58,664 --> 00:08:01,542
What do you think
it's like in space?

90
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:03,669
It's...

91
00:08:04,545 --> 00:08:06,756
beyond understanding.

92
00:08:08,049 --> 00:08:09,300
Yeah.

93
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,512
Who has a baby,

94
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,768
and then just throws it
away like it's nothing?

95
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:23,190
You talking about
your birth parents?

96
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:26,193
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

97
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:31,239
That's bad. Yeah. That's
making me really sad. I...

98
00:08:32,157 --> 00:08:36,036
Sorry that my life
is ruining your high.

99
00:08:37,037 --> 00:08:38,372
It's okay.

100
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,919
I miss you when
you're not around.

101
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,180
I love you, Steve.

102
00:08:58,433 --> 00:08:59,976
I love you.

103
00:09:04,564 --> 00:09:07,150
Space. The endless black deep.

104
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:11,071
What was it that
that guru used to tell us?

105
00:09:18,745 --> 00:09:20,831
There is no time to waste.

106
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:22,417
Do you hear that?

107
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,335
What?

108
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:40,184
There he goes again.

109
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,793
Calligraphy is the artful and
visual expression of communication.

110
00:10:04,877 --> 00:10:06,836
Take Garamond, for example.

111
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:11,215
A typeface specifically designed
to make the very act of reading

112
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:12,967
more natural.

113
00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:28,984
Computers are inherently designed
to make your lives easier.

114
00:10:29,151 --> 00:10:32,279
Theoretically there's no limit
to what computers can do.

115
00:10:49,838 --> 00:10:52,508
It is not who you were
at birth that matters

116
00:10:52,883 --> 00:10:55,928
but what you do with
the time you are given.

117
00:10:56,303 --> 00:10:58,764
The moment of
your death is fixed.

118
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:03,102
Life is but a journey to
serenity, to its completion.

119
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:17,283
Be as simple as you can be.

120
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:19,952
You'll be astonished
to see how uncomplicated

121
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:22,162
and happy your
life can become.

122
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:46,521
I don't even know what I'm
gonna do when I go back home.

123
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,023
What about you?

124
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:52,277
What are you gonna do when
you get back to The Valley?

125
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:53,695
Steve?

126
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,656
Steve? You okay?

127
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:12,548
No. No, no! No. It's
still black and white.

128
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:15,217
People want color.

129
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:17,428
Pong didn't have color.
So?

130
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:19,054
Let's do something better.

131
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,848
It can't do color.

132
00:12:20,931 --> 00:12:21,974
Says who?

133
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:24,393
Okay, you refuse
to do anything

134
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:26,520
that vaguely escapes
your comfort zone.

135
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:27,813
You're not even my boss.

136
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:29,064
Well, I damn sure
should be.

137
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,357
Hey, Jobs!

138
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:32,318
What're you doing, Steve?

139
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:33,444
He's an idiot.

140
00:12:33,693 --> 00:12:35,862
You know, and half
the people around here

141
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:38,324
don't know how
to design shit.

142
00:12:40,868 --> 00:12:43,245
People are complaining
about your behavior.

143
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:45,289
Okay? And, yeah.
About mine?

144
00:12:45,372 --> 00:12:48,167
And your odor.

145
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:49,960
Are you showering
like we discussed?

146
00:12:50,044 --> 00:12:51,128
I'm wearing shoes.
You asked me

147
00:12:51,211 --> 00:12:52,379
to wear shoes,
and I've got them on.

148
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:53,922
That's not part
of the deal, Steve.

149
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,924
You've gotta learn how to
work well with other people.

150
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:00,429
I'm just trying
to do it right, Al.

151
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:01,722
I know you are.

152
00:13:01,805 --> 00:13:02,890
Then let me.

153
00:13:02,973 --> 00:13:04,558
Listen, Steve!

154
00:13:05,142 --> 00:13:07,561
You're good.
You're damn good.

155
00:13:08,813 --> 00:13:10,065
But you're an asshole.

156
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:13,652
Well, that...

157
00:13:13,735 --> 00:13:14,736
Hey. Let me finish.

158
00:13:15,987 --> 00:13:18,531
I want you here.
I really do.

159
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,743
Something's gotta change.

160
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,498
Give me my own project.
What?

161
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:28,083
Give me my own project.

162
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:30,543
I'll do it on my own.

163
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:33,797
And I'll make the best damn
game you have ever seen.

164
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:35,757
You're serious.

165
00:13:38,343 --> 00:13:39,427
Okay, Steve.

166
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,139
I need someone to reprogram
a troublesome game.

167
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:43,391
But I'm on
a tight deadline.

168
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:45,935
So if you can deliver,

169
00:13:46,352 --> 00:13:47,936
we'll pay you
up to $5,000.

170
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:51,815
$5,000?
Mmm-hmm.

171
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:54,025
Okay.

172
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:58,613
And as for your personal issues,
I think I may have a solution.

173
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:06,913
So many circuits.

174
00:14:28,394 --> 00:14:30,271
Woz? Hey, it's Steve.

175
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:46,663
Thanks for saving my ass.

176
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:53,962
Of course. We're friends.
That's, that's what friends do.

177
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:03,512
I just can't work
for other people.

178
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:11,937
I guess I need my independence.
If that makes any sense.

179
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:14,023
Uh-huh.

180
00:15:14,523 --> 00:15:16,734
That makes perfect sense.

181
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:23,825
I'm sorry for ruining
your Friday night.

182
00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:27,788
Are you kidding me?
This is great.

183
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:30,832
I'd do this for free.
I really would.

184
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,711
But just out of curiosity,
how much are we getting paid?

185
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:38,215
$700.

186
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:42,469
Some big bucks there.

187
00:15:53,856 --> 00:15:54,941
Shit.

188
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,110
This is good. Really good.

189
00:15:58,778 --> 00:15:59,904
I know.

190
00:16:01,531 --> 00:16:04,492
Wow. Four days.
You aren't kidding around.

191
00:16:04,992 --> 00:16:08,663
I'll have to show it to Nolan,
but this is, this is good.

192
00:16:24,136 --> 00:16:25,179
Woz?

193
00:16:25,263 --> 00:16:26,681
Hi.
Hi.

194
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:30,351
Woz!

195
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:32,812
Hi! Yeah, I'm
in the living room.

196
00:16:32,937 --> 00:16:34,689
Hey. Good news.

197
00:16:34,772 --> 00:16:37,191
Huh? Let me guess, your
bosses liked the video game.

198
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:38,693
They loved it!
Ooh.

199
00:16:39,235 --> 00:16:41,487
$350. Whew! That's not bad.

200
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:43,447
Not bad? It's great.

201
00:16:44,782 --> 00:16:46,033
What are you working on?

202
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:48,703
I'm writing jokes for
my dial-a-joke machine.

203
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:52,123
I've got some really good funny Polish
jokes, which work because I'm Polish.

204
00:16:52,248 --> 00:16:54,041
Hang out and tell me what
you think of this one.

205
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,209
Ready? Ready?

206
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:59,047
What is long, and hard, that a Polish
bride gets on her wedding night?

207
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:00,883
A new last name.

208
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,054
That's hilarious.

209
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:07,973
Pretty good, isn't it?

210
00:17:08,056 --> 00:17:10,434
What do you call a beautiful
Polish girl? Lucky.

211
00:17:15,063 --> 00:17:16,064
What's that?

212
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:17,482
Hmm?

213
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:21,403
Oh.

214
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:25,741
That. Now that
is gonna be cool.

215
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:28,828
It's a computer terminal board
I'm working on.

216
00:17:29,578 --> 00:17:32,497
Hooks up to the TV
for the display.

217
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,460
What is it like, a kit?
What do you mean?

218
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:37,920
Well, well...

219
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:39,171
The code is still buggy,

220
00:17:39,254 --> 00:17:42,466
but in theory it'll display
whatever you're working on. Like...

221
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:43,800
Show me.

222
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:45,886
Show you. Okay.

223
00:18:07,158 --> 00:18:08,159
Wow.

224
00:18:24,175 --> 00:18:26,928
I don't care if HP
didn't like it. It matters.

225
00:18:27,011 --> 00:18:28,221
Yeah.
It's got potential.

226
00:18:28,304 --> 00:18:31,766
No, the Sex Pistols have potential.
This is the wheel.

227
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,060
It's the
Industrial Revolution.

228
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:35,354
No more decks,
no more mainframes.

229
00:18:35,437 --> 00:18:36,605
That changes everything.

230
00:18:36,689 --> 00:18:37,773
It's pretty cool, I guess.

231
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:38,983
Hi, Charlene. Hello.
Hey.

232
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:42,945
Cool. It's profound. How could you
not tell me about this before?

233
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:45,405
I don't know. I was just working
on it for my own. It, it was a hobby.

234
00:18:45,488 --> 00:18:48,366
Exactly. Exactly.
For your own. For you.

235
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:52,495
It's what you wanted. It's what
your gut, your instinct wanted.

236
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:55,540
Your big evolved brain wanted
something that didn't exist,

237
00:18:55,623 --> 00:18:58,418
so you just willed it
into existence.

238
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:00,795
It's, what do you
call the system?

239
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:01,921
The operating system?

240
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:04,090
The operating, and it just shows you...
That's what I call it.

241
00:19:04,173 --> 00:19:06,552
Yeah, it's just a real time
display of current operations.

242
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:09,680
You can see what you're working
on while you're working on it.

243
00:19:09,763 --> 00:19:11,015
Okay. Look...

244
00:19:11,098 --> 00:19:12,224
Don't you get this?
This is freedom.

245
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:15,853
This is freedom to create,
and to do, and to build,

246
00:19:15,978 --> 00:19:17,813
as artists, as individuals.
Look, look, look.

247
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:19,732
But look,
you're overreacting.

248
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:23,610
Even if you were developing this for
freaks like us, and I doubt you are,

249
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:26,530
nobody wants to buy
a computer. Nobody.

250
00:19:26,613 --> 00:19:30,200
How does somebody know what they
want if they've never even seen it?

251
00:19:30,284 --> 00:19:31,285
Huh?

252
00:19:33,912 --> 00:19:35,289
We're going to Homebrew.

253
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,293
No...

254
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:41,504
lam not presenting
anything at Homebrew.

255
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:43,381
I'm... No.

256
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:48,303
Why do people drive so slow?
Get out! Move!

257
00:19:48,386 --> 00:19:50,263
I'm telling you right now,
I've been to Homebrew.

258
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:52,891
I understand the caliber
of people who speak there.

259
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:54,434
I'm not one of those people.

260
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,895
I'm telling you this thing is amazing.
I'm not...

261
00:19:56,978 --> 00:19:58,562
You're gonna be great, Woz.

262
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:01,148
Steve, could you do me a
favor, could you just please

263
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:02,733
slow down a little bit
so that I feel like

264
00:20:02,816 --> 00:20:05,778
there's a chance we might
actually get there alive.

265
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:08,322
I want to get there first
so we present first.

266
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:11,242
You know if we're
gonna do this thing,

267
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:12,452
we need to come up
with a name.

268
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:14,204
Yeah, I know. Something catchy.
Something...

269
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:15,455
I've been
thinking about it.

270
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:16,664
...electric.

271
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,209
It needs to feel like...
I don't know.

272
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,377
What about
Enterprise Computers?

273
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:22,462
No.

274
00:20:22,545 --> 00:20:24,047
No Star Trek names.
I swear.

275
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,340
What about Kirk Enterprises?

276
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:26,591
I will drive this car
right off this road.

277
00:20:26,674 --> 00:20:27,675
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine!

278
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,927
I will run the car
right off the road.

279
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,929
Jesus! Calm down! Seriously.

280
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:33,181
Okay. Nothing Trekkie. Jesus.

281
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:37,143
It just needs to be, like, something
that people will relate to, you know?

282
00:20:37,227 --> 00:20:38,937
Like, it needs to be
something that you see,

283
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,773
and you're just, like,
"Man, I just gotta have it. "

284
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:46,612
Apple.

285
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,823
Excuse me?

286
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:52,368
Apple.
Apple, like the fruit?

287
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:56,122
The fruit of creation. Apple.
It's simple but sophisticated.

288
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:58,874
It comes before Atari
in the phone book, too.

289
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:04,213
That is so much better
than Phaser Beam Computers.

290
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,966
It's naming it
after a fruit.

291
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:08,676
Apple. Apple Computer.

292
00:21:09,385 --> 00:21:11,261
But, what about
Apple Records?

293
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,471
Apple Records?
The Beatles' label, stu...

294
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:14,974
What, they own
the word "apple"?

295
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:16,225
Why do you always
hate The Beatles?

296
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,351
Well, I do not
hate The Beatles.

297
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,186
Yes, you do. You always...
I do not hate The Beatles.

298
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,188
They're just, they're not
Dylan, and you know that.

299
00:21:21,272 --> 00:21:23,232
Okay, and that's a comparison
that you always make.

300
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,483
Well, I...
'Cause it's obvious.

301
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:25,734
And I don't think it's fair.

302
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:28,612
Apple. Really? Apple?

303
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:31,866
Right, listen. If we come up with
something better, we'll change it.

304
00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:34,743
Let's just go with it
and see if it sticks.

305
00:21:43,252 --> 00:21:47,257
It will display up to
192 memory locations

306
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,676
on the monitor simultaneously.

307
00:21:50,302 --> 00:21:54,806
Allow me to explain because it's
quite fascinating, actually.

308
00:21:56,766 --> 00:21:59,603
The logic board is rather complex,
especially compared to some of

309
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:02,939
the other boards here,
including of course,

310
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:05,692
the Altair.

311
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:09,237
And as you can see...

312
00:22:09,654 --> 00:22:13,408
it's much smaller, and cheaper
to manufacture and build...

313
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:17,579
which, by using
dynamic RAM, I was able...

314
00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:23,461
We were able to shrink the size
of the board substantially.

315
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:25,462
So, it works with
your television?

316
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:27,297
Yes, YES, yes, yes!

317
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:31,551
It will work on any
television, or video monitor.

318
00:22:31,635 --> 00:22:35,222
All you need is
a radio frequency converter

319
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:39,100
to display the images
from your microprocessor

320
00:22:39,184 --> 00:22:41,186
to your set output device.

321
00:22:42,812 --> 00:22:44,648
And it'll run BASIC.

322
00:22:48,235 --> 00:22:52,490
It will also run BASIC, which
I think could be a great...

323
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:57,578
So I guess that wraps it up. Thank
you very much for your time.

324
00:22:57,828 --> 00:23:01,040
This was terrific. Fuck.

325
00:23:01,832 --> 00:23:03,334
Tough crowd.

326
00:23:05,628 --> 00:23:07,088
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm Frank.

327
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:08,214
I'm Lutz.

328
00:23:08,297 --> 00:23:12,343
And we're here with reduced
instruction set computing CPU.

329
00:23:19,684 --> 00:23:23,104
Excuse me.
Name is Paul Terrell.

330
00:23:25,274 --> 00:23:26,692
Saw your presentation.

331
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,193
And?

332
00:23:28,277 --> 00:23:29,903
And I'd like
to talk business.

333
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:33,448
What can I do for you?
Well...

334
00:23:33,532 --> 00:23:36,785
I own a local computer parts
store, in Mountainview.

335
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:37,995
The Byte Shop?

336
00:23:38,078 --> 00:23:39,287
You buy computer parts.

337
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,832
Yeah. We sell transistors, boards,
soldering equipment, monitors.

338
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:44,375
You know, hobbyist types.

339
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:45,584
Like Radio Shack?

340
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,378
No.

341
00:23:47,545 --> 00:23:51,340
Listen, why don't you stop
by and talk to me some time.

342
00:23:51,424 --> 00:23:53,634
There's my card.
Give me a call.

343
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,303
Great.

344
00:23:55,386 --> 00:23:56,680
It was nice meeting you.

345
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,265
Steve Jobs.

346
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,850
Steve Jobs. All right.

347
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:05,564
Who was that?

348
00:24:06,815 --> 00:24:08,567
It's Paul Terrell.
Oh.

349
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:11,320
Who?

350
00:24:47,648 --> 00:24:49,859
So what kind of investment
are we talking about here?

351
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:53,737
Jesus, Steve. I said I was
interested, not buying.

352
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,282
I know. But you're also not
the only interested party.

353
00:24:57,366 --> 00:24:59,076
Oh, really? I'm not?
No.

354
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:00,202
You're not.
Hmm.

355
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:01,371
That's interesting.

356
00:25:01,454 --> 00:25:03,581
Because it sure seemed that way
the other night at Homebrew.

357
00:25:03,664 --> 00:25:06,292
You think that's the
first stop that we made?

358
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:08,503
We've been
all over The Valley.

359
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:11,798
Oh, well, then you
already have a retailer.

360
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:13,132
I got offers.

361
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:17,553
Look, Paul My middle name's Paul.
My dad's name is Paul.

362
00:25:17,678 --> 00:25:19,430
Bunch of Pauls. I'm...

363
00:25:19,514 --> 00:25:21,015
I think we're
kindred spirits here.

364
00:25:21,808 --> 00:25:24,685
We're both businessmen
that operate from our gut.

365
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:28,272
And my gut tells me to
give you this opportunity.

366
00:25:32,276 --> 00:25:36,907
I'm thinking $400 per machine, for 50
units, paid at the time of delivery.

367
00:25:38,992 --> 00:25:40,994
$400 for a hundred units,
a third up front.

368
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:42,204
We're not negotiating.

369
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:43,330
Yes, we are.

370
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:51,630
Okay. I'll pay $450
per machine. $450.

371
00:25:52,548 --> 00:25:56,427
On delivery, nothing up front. I
know it's asking a lot, Steve.

372
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,096
But it's a big payoff
if you deliver.

373
00:25:59,513 --> 00:26:01,181
When I deliver.

374
00:26:04,852 --> 00:26:07,563
$500 per unit and
you've got a deal.

375
00:26:10,858 --> 00:26:13,944
All right.
You got 90 days.

376
00:26:15,195 --> 00:26:16,738
I'll have it in 60.

377
00:26:22,286 --> 00:26:25,080
Daniel and I just didn't have
room at our place, so...

378
00:26:25,164 --> 00:26:27,124
No, no.
I'm glad you asked.

379
00:26:29,877 --> 00:26:32,629
We could move some things around,
give it a good cleaning.

380
00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:35,466
I could move most of
my tools to the shed.

381
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:37,843
Maybe get you boys
a fan when it gets hot.

382
00:26:37,926 --> 00:26:39,012
Ooh.

383
00:26:40,513 --> 00:26:42,182
What do you think?

384
00:26:42,724 --> 00:26:44,058
It's great, Dad.

385
00:26:44,142 --> 00:26:46,686
Yes. It is.
This is perfect.

386
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:50,440
Good. Well, it'll be good to
see you building something.

387
00:26:51,232 --> 00:26:56,362
Good. Hey, keep it neat.

388
00:26:57,071 --> 00:26:58,156
Inside and out.

389
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:01,201
Thanks, Mr. J.
Mmm.

390
00:27:07,123 --> 00:27:08,458
We got a shop.

391
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,128
Yes, we do.

392
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:26,518
How's it going?

393
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:33,983
<i>And voilà.</i>

394
00:27:35,902 --> 00:27:39,364
It's gotta be straighter. These
have to be more symmetrical.

395
00:27:40,573 --> 00:27:42,242
We have 60 days to
complete 50 of these,

396
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:43,744
and you're worried
about the symmetry?

397
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:46,247
Steve, nobody cares
about the look of the board.

398
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,290
I care.
Well, that's just great.

399
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,960
But we were out of time the minute
you made that stupid promise.

400
00:27:54,004 --> 00:27:55,130
You're right.

401
00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:58,300
Need help.

402
00:28:00,386 --> 00:28:01,428
Woz.
Huh?

403
00:28:02,596 --> 00:28:04,056
We got a problem.
Huh?

404
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:08,102
We got to figure out what to
do with all these employees.

405
00:28:09,436 --> 00:28:10,479
You know Bill?
Bill.

406
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,231
Too long, Woz.
How are you?

407
00:28:12,314 --> 00:28:13,566
Good to see you.
How is everyone?

408
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:14,775
Oh, this is my friend
Daniel Kottke.

409
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:16,194
Hey. I've heard a lot about you.
How're you doing?

410
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,948
Kottke? Kottke from
India, of course.

411
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,408
I've heard a lot
about you, too.

412
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,159
Don't touch that.

413
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,121
That's Chris Espinosa. Kid down the
street I was telling you about?

414
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,373
Nice to meet you, fella.
This is gonna be so cool.

415
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,168
Great. I'm so glad
that you're excited

416
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,837
about this thing
we're doing here.

417
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,045
Can I talk to you
for a second?

418
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:36,171
Yeah.

419
00:28:36,255 --> 00:28:38,924
Excuse me, just please stop.
And go over there.

420
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,343
Just out of the way,
over there.

421
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,562
We can't afford to pay
three people right now.

422
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:56,568
We can't afford to pay
ourselves, unless we deliver.

423
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,655
And don't worry about Chris.
He's just a kid. So he just wants to help.

424
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,117
You're just a kid.

425
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,244
Cheese!

426
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,207
Thanks, Mom.

427
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,501
So embarrassing.

428
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:35,085
All right.
As promised.

429
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:38,213
Nice board.

430
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:47,055
Where's the rest?

431
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,392
The rest?
This is all of them.

432
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:52,394
I asked for 50 computers.

433
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:56,231
That's keyboards, cases,
monitors, and power included.

434
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:58,109
Not just boards.

435
00:30:58,526 --> 00:31:02,822
Just boards? Excuse me? Just boards?
These are state-of-the-art.

436
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:07,200
The logic boards alone are...
Nobody's making anything like this.

437
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:09,953
They're, what, how dare you!
How dare you!

438
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:13,832
I think what my colleague
is saying is that...

439
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,043
You're not seeing
the possibilities here.

440
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:20,255
That is indeed one unbelievably
kick ass computer.

441
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:22,299
Not to the consumer.

442
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,675
Well, then maybe
your consumer

443
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:25,302
should start to
learn how to...

444
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:26,511
How to even work that,
don't you think?

445
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:28,221
Listen, boys.

446
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:33,269
You sold me on a home computer.
That's a keyboard and monitor.

447
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:34,896
This is a board.

448
00:31:35,396 --> 00:31:37,273
Now, I'm sure this makes
a very capable starter kit,

449
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:38,775
but the everyday person,

450
00:31:38,858 --> 00:31:40,902
the kind of person
that's not an engineer,

451
00:31:40,985 --> 00:31:43,154
or in a computer club like you,

452
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:45,615
they're not gonna know
what the hell this is.

453
00:31:45,698 --> 00:31:48,826
The average Joe doesn't want
to build their own computer.

454
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,244
They just want to buy it.

455
00:31:50,328 --> 00:31:52,663
They want to take it out
of the box, plug it in,

456
00:31:52,747 --> 00:31:54,582
and have it work.

457
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:55,833
Steve.

458
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:59,003
Are you listening to me?

459
00:31:59,462 --> 00:32:03,717
Yeah. These are your boards.

460
00:32:04,885 --> 00:32:06,595
And they will sell.

461
00:32:06,678 --> 00:32:09,056
I can promise you that.

462
00:32:10,057 --> 00:32:11,850
You saw our demo
at Homebrew.

463
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:13,977
You know what it's capable of
with the right components,

464
00:32:14,061 --> 00:32:17,271
which, by the way,
all of which you sell.

465
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:21,734
So, demo it to the consumer.

466
00:32:21,818 --> 00:32:23,945
And market
the components separately.

467
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,239
You show them your keyboards,
and your monitors.

468
00:32:26,322 --> 00:32:27,949
You'll move more
inventory that way,

469
00:32:28,032 --> 00:32:29,867
and you'll make a hell
of a lot more cash.

470
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:33,496
You got me.

471
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:39,837
All right, Steve.

472
00:32:40,546 --> 00:32:41,713
I'll try to sell them.

473
00:32:42,756 --> 00:32:46,510
But if I don't, I'm not
making another order.

474
00:32:46,593 --> 00:32:48,679
Okay. That's fine.

475
00:32:48,762 --> 00:32:52,266
But I think that you might be really
interested in our second model.

476
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:54,059
What's the second model?

477
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,354
What are you talking about?

478
00:32:58,856 --> 00:33:00,274
All-in-one.

479
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,892
Can I help you?

480
00:33:34,975 --> 00:33:36,476
Yeah, I'm Rod Holt.

481
00:33:37,936 --> 00:33:40,523
The technician.
We talked on the phone.

482
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:43,192
Of course. It's Rod.

483
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,073
Glad you could stop by.

484
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:52,327
Welcome to Apple Computer.

485
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:56,372
All right.

486
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:01,544
Show me this
revolutionary piece of shit.

487
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:03,588
The Apple ll.

488
00:34:05,048 --> 00:34:08,676
It's the first ever all-in-one
personal home computer.

489
00:34:09,344 --> 00:34:10,511
And you called
me because?

490
00:34:12,014 --> 00:34:16,310
We need a heat efficient power supply.
In the case.

491
00:34:16,518 --> 00:34:18,854
That's impossible,
but don't mind me.

492
00:34:18,938 --> 00:34:20,898
I'm just, you know,
an engineer.

493
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:22,608
What's the wattage?

494
00:34:22,691 --> 00:34:24,985
40 watts. And quiet.

495
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:27,863
What the hell do you mean, quiet?
I mean silent.

496
00:34:27,988 --> 00:34:29,823
There's no such thing.

497
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,618
These things run hot.
They need fans in them.

498
00:34:32,701 --> 00:34:34,036
Those bitches ain't quiet.

499
00:34:36,288 --> 00:34:38,290
That's exactly
why we need you.

500
00:34:39,124 --> 00:34:40,668
To redesign it.

501
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,419
Redesign what?

502
00:34:42,503 --> 00:34:44,797
The power supply.
From scratch.

503
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,009
It can't have a fan,
it can't overheat.

504
00:34:49,218 --> 00:34:52,888
And it needs to fit
inside a box this size.

505
00:35:03,565 --> 00:35:06,318
Don't do that.
Please, don't do...

506
00:35:06,402 --> 00:35:08,737
Whatever.
Do whatever you want.

507
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:21,251
My rate is $200 a day.

508
00:35:21,668 --> 00:35:24,170
And if I ever think things
aren't working out, I walk.

509
00:35:24,254 --> 00:35:25,255
Mmm-hmm.

510
00:35:25,588 --> 00:35:26,881
Are we clear?

511
00:35:27,924 --> 00:35:29,384
We're clear.

512
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:34,556
We're talking
about the future.

513
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,434
We're working in a market
that doesn't even exist yet.

514
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:40,020
What Intel has done
for the microprocessor,

515
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,814
we are gonna do for
the home computer.

516
00:35:46,818 --> 00:35:49,405
How can you not know
what I'm talking about?

517
00:35:52,575 --> 00:35:55,995
No, ma'am. But it
runs on a TV monitor.

518
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,956
Yes, like a television set.
Exactly.

519
00:36:00,665 --> 00:36:04,961
I don't think you understand. It's not a TV.
It's a personal computer.

520
00:36:05,587 --> 00:36:07,881
Okay, do you own
a typewriter?

521
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:12,177
Great. Okay, now do you use it?
Perfect.

522
00:36:12,302 --> 00:36:16,723
So imagine combining your typewriter
with your television set.

523
00:36:19,434 --> 00:36:21,395
No. Don't... Wait. Wait!

524
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:24,315
Wait. Please, sir,
don't, don't hang up.

525
00:36:26,108 --> 00:36:30,154
Yes. We are small
right now, but we...

526
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:34,450
How do you know we're
working out of our garage?

527
00:36:34,658 --> 00:36:36,619
Who told you that?

528
00:36:38,913 --> 00:36:40,289
Ahhh!

529
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:44,168
Yes. Yes.

530
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,754
Well, thank you
for taking the time.

531
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,760
Yes, sir. Apple Computer.

532
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:57,099
Apple? Yes, like the fruit.

533
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:00,852
Who's that?

534
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,358
No. No. All I'm asking is
that you come visit us.

535
00:37:06,775 --> 00:37:09,986
One meeting and I promise
you'll be on board.

536
00:37:10,904 --> 00:37:13,989
Around $50,000
would be my guess.

537
00:37:15,825 --> 00:37:17,159
Hello?

538
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,378
What did they say?

539
00:37:48,692 --> 00:37:51,069
What the hell is
the matter with people?

540
00:37:51,444 --> 00:37:52,737
Take it the call went well.

541
00:37:55,031 --> 00:37:58,411
I would say I hope you choke, but that
burrito is gonna kill you either way.

542
00:37:58,578 --> 00:38:00,037
Oh, come on, Steve.

543
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:01,956
Cool your jets, man.

544
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:03,541
Excuse you?

545
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:06,210
Just, you know, you're
so stressed, you know?

546
00:38:06,294 --> 00:38:08,254
It's, like,
relax for a change.

547
00:38:08,629 --> 00:38:11,757
For a change... Why? Why? So I can
be more like you two assholes?

548
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:15,344
Hey. I'm studying integrated
circuit design here, man.

549
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:16,596
Are you?

550
00:38:18,055 --> 00:38:19,223
We each do our part.

551
00:38:19,307 --> 00:38:22,935
Really? Then why do I suddenly
feel like your part is expendable?

552
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,898
Out here smokin' up like we're in India.
Well, wake up! We're not.

553
00:38:30,902 --> 00:38:31,986
What happened to you?

554
00:38:32,236 --> 00:38:33,738
You used to be...
What? I used to be what?

555
00:38:33,821 --> 00:38:35,406
Motivated.
I am motivated.

556
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:36,782
Really? Then show me.

557
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:39,160
This is a business, Daniel.

558
00:38:39,493 --> 00:38:42,079
And I can't help you
if you don't help yourself.

559
00:38:43,831 --> 00:38:46,459
I'm in there making
a hundred phone calls.

560
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:49,086
Rod is slaving away.

561
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:51,297
The kid always finds
something to do,

562
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,632
and God knows Woz
pulls his weight.

563
00:38:52,715 --> 00:38:53,758
Thank you.

564
00:38:53,841 --> 00:38:55,301
And that's
a whole lot of weight.

565
00:38:55,384 --> 00:38:57,803
That really... That kind
of hurts my feelings.

566
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:06,230
Whoa.

567
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,488
Is this the right...

568
00:39:15,948 --> 00:39:17,074
Apple Computer?

569
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:19,618
Yeah, this is us.
Yeah.

570
00:39:19,701 --> 00:39:20,827
You expecting something else?

571
00:39:22,955 --> 00:39:27,125
Uh, no. Well, yeah, maybe something
a little less Manson Family.

572
00:39:28,585 --> 00:39:29,920
It's a startup.
Yeah.

573
00:39:30,254 --> 00:39:31,713
I'm Mike Markkula.

574
00:39:32,714 --> 00:39:34,216
Steve. Jobs.

575
00:39:34,466 --> 00:39:36,427
Steve. I heard
a lot about you.

576
00:39:36,636 --> 00:39:39,055
You spoke to Don Valentine
on the phone.

577
00:39:39,138 --> 00:39:40,806
He and I are old
colleagues of sorts.

578
00:39:41,306 --> 00:39:43,100
The VC from Atari.

579
00:39:43,225 --> 00:39:46,019
Yeah, Valentine. He said
you called him 150 times.

580
00:39:46,103 --> 00:39:47,437
Jesus.

581
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:50,440
He practically begged me to come
and look at your outfit here.

582
00:39:50,524 --> 00:39:51,942
Called in
a personal favor.

583
00:39:52,776 --> 00:39:53,860
Well, Mark.

584
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:56,029
- Mike.
- Mike.

585
00:39:58,407 --> 00:39:59,866
Welcome to Apple Computer.

586
00:40:00,575 --> 00:40:02,869
Thank you.
Yeah, is this...

587
00:40:03,704 --> 00:40:04,705
This is everything?

588
00:40:04,788 --> 00:40:06,039
Yes.
No.

589
00:40:06,123 --> 00:40:08,501
No. We're, we're in six stores
in the greater area.

590
00:40:09,002 --> 00:40:11,546
We'll be launching the
Apple ll in about a month.

591
00:40:11,629 --> 00:40:13,631
In a few months.
It's close.

592
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:16,884
Gentlemen, is there
some place we can talk?

593
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:23,308
Here you are, fellas.

594
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,976
For you.

595
00:40:26,144 --> 00:40:29,522
Steve's a fruitarian.
He will only eat fruit.

596
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:33,651
Okay, boys. I'll leave
you to your business.

597
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:34,777
Thank you.

598
00:40:34,902 --> 00:40:36,529
Thanks, Mom.
Thanks, Mrs. J.

599
00:40:36,612 --> 00:40:37,864
You're the best.

600
00:40:37,947 --> 00:40:41,285
Yeah. So where were we?

601
00:40:41,368 --> 00:40:45,247
I'm sorry, don't take this the
wrong way, but what's your angle?

602
00:40:45,331 --> 00:40:46,373
Uh...

603
00:40:46,457 --> 00:40:48,000
What my colleague is
trying to say is...

604
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:49,418
Where was your
last employment?

605
00:40:54,256 --> 00:40:55,298
Intel.

606
00:40:58,426 --> 00:40:59,844
So how much are we
talking about here?

607
00:41:00,011 --> 00:41:01,846
What, the investment? That's
what you came here for.

608
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:04,057
Foreplay is not
Steve's strong suit.

609
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,350
Isn't it?

610
00:41:06,434 --> 00:41:07,852
Yeah, well,

611
00:41:09,645 --> 00:41:13,776
I've been looking for something
to really sink my teeth into.

612
00:41:21,658 --> 00:41:24,286
Look, Steve. I'm willing
to take the risk.

613
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,289
And, this
certainly qualifies.

614
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:29,458
But risk disguised
as promise.

615
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,835
And you've shown promise.
I've seen it in your eye,

616
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,129
and I know that look
because I've had it myself.

617
00:41:35,464 --> 00:41:37,424
Tells me you're
on to something big.

618
00:41:45,308 --> 00:41:47,143
Yeah. Okay. To the point.

619
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,145
I think we should start
with around 90 grand,

620
00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:51,314
see where that takes us.

621
00:41:52,816 --> 00:41:55,777
Okay, I'm sorry.
Could you repeat that?

622
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,153
I'm sorry.

623
00:41:57,821 --> 00:41:59,614
$90,000 isn't
gonna get it done.

624
00:41:59,697 --> 00:42:01,866
Oh, whoa, whoa. Wait.
Steve, one second.

625
00:42:01,991 --> 00:42:04,202
I don't see anybody else coming
in your garage with a checkbook.

626
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:05,495
Oh, no, no.

627
00:42:05,578 --> 00:42:07,997
Ninety grand
gets it done for us.

628
00:42:08,081 --> 00:42:10,416
I just don't think it
gets it done for you.

629
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,836
We'll do the
$90,000 investment.

630
00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:16,130
At a $300,000 valuation.

631
00:42:16,213 --> 00:42:18,675
But I also want you to kick
in a $250,000 credit line

632
00:42:18,758 --> 00:42:21,094
with 10% interest to
be paid back in full

633
00:42:21,177 --> 00:42:23,847
once we meet
net revenue positive.

634
00:42:33,189 --> 00:42:34,357
Okay.

635
00:42:38,736 --> 00:42:39,988
What I mean is, okay.

636
00:42:42,323 --> 00:42:43,408
Yeah.

637
00:42:45,535 --> 00:42:47,620
Now, the first thing
you need to do

638
00:42:47,704 --> 00:42:51,709
is incorporate, so that you two as
owners can protect your interest.

639
00:42:53,419 --> 00:42:56,672
And that is, of course,
if you'll have me aboard.

640
00:42:58,757 --> 00:43:00,050
Thank you very much,
Mr. Markkula.

641
00:43:00,134 --> 00:43:01,927
Of course. Mike. Yeah.

642
00:43:02,052 --> 00:43:03,220
How're you doing?
Yeah, put her there.

643
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:04,555
- Bill.
- Bill?

644
00:43:04,638 --> 00:43:05,639
- Fernandez.
- Yeah.

645
00:43:05,723 --> 00:43:07,224
Oh. Thanks, Mike.
Yeah.

646
00:43:07,308 --> 00:43:09,351
Steve. Here's to you, pal.

647
00:43:20,696 --> 00:43:22,615
Are you even listening to me?

648
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,867
I'm pregnant.

649
00:43:28,078 --> 00:43:29,663
Steve, you have
to talk to me.

650
00:43:31,457 --> 00:43:33,751
This is your
responsibility, too.

651
00:43:36,462 --> 00:43:38,088
Don't you dare

652
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:40,090
blame this on me.

653
00:43:42,968 --> 00:43:44,261
I'm not.
Mmm-mmm.

654
00:43:46,096 --> 00:43:49,433
We both had
our moments of...

655
00:43:49,975 --> 00:43:51,477
What? What the hell
are you talking about?

656
00:43:51,602 --> 00:43:52,770
You.

657
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:58,985
When I was in India,
you were with, you know.

658
00:43:59,319 --> 00:44:01,988
Steve? Are you crazy? You
cannot put this all on me.

659
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:05,534
You can't do this to me
right now. Not now.

660
00:44:05,951 --> 00:44:08,286
Well, I'm sorry this
isn't part of your plan.

661
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:10,705
I'm sorry you
have a problem.

662
00:44:12,165 --> 00:44:13,833
But it's not
happening to me.

663
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:16,461
But this is your...
No!

664
00:44:19,631 --> 00:44:20,674
Get out of my house.

665
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:22,175
What?
Now!

666
00:44:26,012 --> 00:44:27,807
Oh, Jesus. Here we go.

667
00:44:37,566 --> 00:44:40,193
Hey. Is everything
okay out here?

668
00:44:40,986 --> 00:44:43,863
Steven, he's kicking me out.

669
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:48,159
He doesn't want
anything to do with me.

670
00:44:52,539 --> 00:44:54,833
Maybe it's for the best.

671
00:44:54,916 --> 00:44:58,169
You don't deserve to be treated
the way he treats you.

672
00:44:58,336 --> 00:45:00,172
I'm pregnant, Daniel.

673
00:45:01,048 --> 00:45:02,300
What? You're...

674
00:45:03,759 --> 00:45:06,262
He says it's not his,
but I would never...

675
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,143
What did I do wrong?

676
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:18,232
You didn't do
anything wrong.

677
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:21,402
It's Steve.

678
00:45:22,403 --> 00:45:24,030
That's just him.

679
00:45:28,075 --> 00:45:29,410
He changed.

680
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:51,994
Hook them right
to your television.

681
00:46:59,502 --> 00:47:01,212
His,yeah.

682
00:47:07,634 --> 00:47:09,929
What do you think, J?
Ready?

683
00:47:23,526 --> 00:47:26,320
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Steve Jobs.

684
00:47:27,363 --> 00:47:29,198
When I founded
this company,

685
00:47:29,657 --> 00:47:31,451
I had one goal in mind.

686
00:47:32,034 --> 00:47:35,413
And that was to do what nobody
else considered possible.

687
00:47:36,122 --> 00:47:38,458
To put the power
and the beauty

688
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:40,836
of the world's most
advanced technology

689
00:47:41,295 --> 00:47:44,840
in the hands and homes of
people just like you and me.

690
00:47:45,674 --> 00:47:48,635
And I can promise you
that after today,

691
00:47:49,511 --> 00:47:52,264
you will never look at
computers the same way again.

692
00:47:53,432 --> 00:47:57,519
So I am proud to introduce
to you, and the world,

693
00:47:58,187 --> 00:48:00,814
the future of
personal computing.

694
00:48:01,648 --> 00:48:04,151
The revolutionary Apple ll.

695
00:49:26,193 --> 00:49:30,239
Gotta just start over.
It has to be intuitive.

696
00:49:30,906 --> 00:49:34,200
Precognitive. I mean, I want
it to know what you want to do

697
00:49:34,284 --> 00:49:36,119
before you even know
you want to do it.

698
00:49:36,244 --> 00:49:38,037
Wait, are we still talking
about the command prompts?

699
00:49:38,121 --> 00:49:41,457
Bill, we're talking about everything.
The whole thing.

700
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:45,962
Lisa. Guys, it's the future.
I'm telling you right now.

701
00:49:46,045 --> 00:49:49,924
I mean, Lisa's gonna do
for the next 10 years

702
00:49:50,008 --> 00:49:52,052
what the Apple ll
did for the last three.

703
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:54,305
I can tell you
that right now.

704
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:57,141
Do you know why
people buy an Apple?

705
00:49:57,558 --> 00:49:59,977
Why do they buy an Apple,
not the competitor?

706
00:50:01,812 --> 00:50:03,314
Because it's got bravado.

707
00:50:03,981 --> 00:50:05,733
It's social status.

708
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:07,234
No, you know what?
It's even more than that.

709
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:08,652
It's social currency.

710
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,905
We've raised the bar.

711
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,744
And if we want to stay there,
we gotta risk everything.

712
00:50:17,828 --> 00:50:23,168
Great artists, Dylan, Picasso,
Newton, they risk failure.

713
00:50:23,835 --> 00:50:27,464
And if we want to be great,
we've gotta risk it, too.

714
00:50:27,964 --> 00:50:29,049
On the command bar?

715
00:50:29,132 --> 00:50:30,175
On everything.

716
00:50:30,216 --> 00:50:32,385
What... And it starts
with the little things.

717
00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:34,095
There's over 20
different functions

718
00:50:34,179 --> 00:50:36,556
tied to every single variation
of the command bar,

719
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,725
which by the way,
takes weeks to program.

720
00:50:38,808 --> 00:50:42,020
We're not doing anything that
IBM's not already doing.

721
00:50:42,938 --> 00:50:45,690
And I would rather
gamble on our vision

722
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,943
than make a me-too product.

723
00:50:49,026 --> 00:50:53,072
We got to make the small
things just unforgettable.

724
00:50:53,572 --> 00:50:55,825
Let's just start with something simple.
LisaWrite.

725
00:50:55,909 --> 00:50:58,703
What happens if I click
on one of these tabs?

726
00:50:58,787 --> 00:51:01,373
You get a drop-down menu,
and then there's preferences,

727
00:51:01,456 --> 00:51:02,666
and page options.

728
00:51:02,749 --> 00:51:04,292
Okay. Exactly.

729
00:51:05,126 --> 00:51:09,839
Now, which tab do I click on
to get different font styles?

730
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:19,391
How many custom typefaces
are there on LisaWrite?

731
00:51:20,725 --> 00:51:23,353
That's actually something that I wanted
to talk to you about, Steve, is...

732
00:51:23,436 --> 00:51:25,397
I've been asking for
the fonts for months.

733
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,692
But everything we're talking
about is conceptual.

734
00:51:27,775 --> 00:51:32,613
And I'm sorry, but typeface, it isn't
exactly a pressing issue right now.

735
00:51:34,615 --> 00:51:38,077
Everything is
a pressing issue.

736
00:51:39,245 --> 00:51:43,082
If we want to make the
vision for Lisa a reality,

737
00:51:44,083 --> 00:51:47,420
we gotta put in the hours
and make something great.

738
00:51:47,503 --> 00:51:50,548
Yeah, but we have a hard
date on this software,

739
00:51:50,631 --> 00:51:53,467
and I'm sorry, but adding pretty
fonts is not gonna change that.

740
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,137
Well, Bill?

741
00:51:57,596 --> 00:52:01,183
If you don't share
our enthusiasm,

742
00:52:01,934 --> 00:52:05,730
and care for the vision
of this company...

743
00:52:05,813 --> 00:52:07,523
No, no, no, no. I just,
I'm not understanding...

744
00:52:07,606 --> 00:52:08,983
Get out.
What?

745
00:52:10,443 --> 00:52:12,486
Get your shit and get out.
What, wait...

746
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,030
You're done.
What, you...

747
00:52:14,113 --> 00:52:15,364
What, are you gonna,
you're gonna fire me?

748
00:52:15,448 --> 00:52:16,574
No!

749
00:52:16,657 --> 00:52:18,659
I already fired you!

750
00:52:20,161 --> 00:52:22,204
Why are you still here?

751
00:52:30,004 --> 00:52:32,466
Steve, he was our best
programmer in the division.

752
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:36,053
He's the best programmer that
doesn't care about our vision.

753
00:52:37,095 --> 00:52:39,014
Okay. Look, I know it's not
my place to say it, but...

754
00:52:39,097 --> 00:52:40,724
Then shut
the hell up, Bill!

755
00:52:40,974 --> 00:52:42,017
Yeah.

756
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,561
So sorry to interrupt
you, Mr. Jobs,

757
00:52:44,644 --> 00:52:47,272
but your attorney is
here for your 8:00.

758
00:52:47,981 --> 00:52:49,357
All right.

759
00:52:51,276 --> 00:52:53,820
I want to see samples
this afternoon.

760
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:59,201
Somehow we managed to design a word
processor that doesn't have fonts.

761
00:52:59,951 --> 00:53:02,329
And it can't happen again.

762
00:53:03,705 --> 00:53:05,416
So fix it!

763
00:53:19,304 --> 00:53:22,432
2:00 to 3:00. And your
10:00 is waiting for you.

764
00:53:26,019 --> 00:53:27,729
Steve. Steve, hey.

765
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,190
Daniel. Hey.

766
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,567
Do you have
a second to talk?

767
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,281
I thought we rescheduled.

768
00:53:37,698 --> 00:53:39,575
It'll only take a second.

769
00:53:40,409 --> 00:53:41,828
That's what everyone says.

770
00:53:41,911 --> 00:53:42,995
Steve.

771
00:53:48,835 --> 00:53:50,044
Fine.

772
00:53:51,212 --> 00:53:54,841
I don't have a lunch, so, meet
me at Good Earth at noon.

773
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:57,135
Okay. Cool.
Okay.

774
00:53:57,844 --> 00:53:59,053
What are you
working on these days?

775
00:53:59,512 --> 00:54:00,721
Oh, um...

776
00:54:01,013 --> 00:54:03,182
Apple ll Plus repairs, mainly.

777
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,768
Right.

778
00:54:13,861 --> 00:54:15,154
I need you to sign this.

779
00:54:15,237 --> 00:54:16,738
It legally preserves
your visitation rights.

780
00:54:16,822 --> 00:54:21,201
I don't want them.
Lisa Brennan is not my child.

781
00:54:21,785 --> 00:54:23,370
The courts disagree.

782
00:54:23,453 --> 00:54:27,666
Chris-Ann is a lunatic. It's impossible.
At the very least, improbable.

783
00:54:27,749 --> 00:54:29,000
You knew going into this

784
00:54:29,083 --> 00:54:32,086
the paternity test could prove
that you were the father.

785
00:54:32,795 --> 00:54:34,547
There are 24 million
people in California.

786
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:36,340
That test has a five
percent margin of error.

787
00:54:36,424 --> 00:54:39,760
That's 1.2 million people that
could be the father of that child.

788
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:41,722
It's not me.

789
00:54:43,432 --> 00:54:47,477
You don't need to convince me.
But you do need to sign this.

790
00:54:48,061 --> 00:54:50,856
Miss Brennan is entitled
to your child support

791
00:54:50,939 --> 00:54:53,734
regardless of whether
you sign it or not.

792
00:54:54,026 --> 00:54:57,279
Do you really want to give
up the rights to see your...

793
00:54:57,362 --> 00:55:00,073
To see her child
in the future?

794
00:55:00,157 --> 00:55:02,034
I don't have time.

795
00:55:02,618 --> 00:55:03,660
Not now.

796
00:55:03,744 --> 00:55:07,206
Steven, as a father, I
implore you to sign this.

797
00:55:07,831 --> 00:55:11,043
Regardless of whether you think
Lisa is your daughter or not.

798
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:13,795
There's no risk in signing.

799
00:55:14,255 --> 00:55:16,799
Only the regret
if you don't.

800
00:55:26,976 --> 00:55:29,896
Frederick Rodney Holt,
he recently made

801
00:55:30,188 --> 00:55:32,315
an additional
preferred purchase

802
00:55:32,398 --> 00:55:37,153
of 106,656 shares
at 19 cents a share.

803
00:55:37,654 --> 00:55:39,364
Right, and to be clear,
this new purchase,

804
00:55:39,447 --> 00:55:41,324
it does not affect
Mr. Holt's entitlement to

805
00:55:41,741 --> 00:55:43,158
founder stock.

806
00:55:43,242 --> 00:55:45,077
No, not at all. Steve?

807
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,288
No,no,no.
Rod gets his due.

808
00:55:48,164 --> 00:55:49,207
Daniel Kottke,

809
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:53,419
engineering technician, founding employee.
Now, at our last meeting I,

810
00:55:54,087 --> 00:55:56,005
I don't believe that
we met a consensus

811
00:55:56,089 --> 00:55:59,884
as to Mr. Kottke's entitlement
to founder stock.

812
00:56:00,927 --> 00:56:03,137
Well, in all honesty,
to be rewarding Daniel

813
00:56:03,221 --> 00:56:05,390
with the same amount
of stock as Rod seems

814
00:56:05,473 --> 00:56:07,642
a bit unfair.
Doesn't it?

815
00:56:09,143 --> 00:56:11,729
Yes. Daniel gets nothing.

816
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:13,314
Nothing?

817
00:56:13,856 --> 00:56:14,941
Don't you think
you should

818
00:56:15,024 --> 00:56:17,068
think about what you're
doing, for a second?

819
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,531
I have thought about it.
Daniel gets nothing.

820
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:22,574
Yes, sir.

821
00:56:22,658 --> 00:56:24,118
It's noted.

822
00:56:25,202 --> 00:56:26,578
What?

823
00:56:26,954 --> 00:56:29,623
Any low grade technician
could do his job.

824
00:56:29,707 --> 00:56:32,668
I've been feeding him for years.
It's not personal.

825
00:56:32,751 --> 00:56:35,129
Don't give me that bullshit, Steve.
Of course it's personal.

826
00:56:35,212 --> 00:56:36,422
He can barely do his job.

827
00:56:36,505 --> 00:56:37,715
If we give Daniel
preferred stock,

828
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:40,634
some engineer with 10 times
his talent gets nothing.

829
00:56:40,718 --> 00:56:41,802
Then what happens?

830
00:56:41,885 --> 00:56:43,929
Then we just draw this line
right here, right now, okay?

831
00:56:44,013 --> 00:56:46,098
So you, what are you talking about?
Management, or...

832
00:56:46,181 --> 00:56:47,474
Management and engineers.

833
00:56:47,558 --> 00:56:48,559
Yeah, this means...

834
00:56:48,642 --> 00:56:50,728
I know what it means, Mike.

835
00:56:51,187 --> 00:56:52,397
Thanks.

836
00:56:53,773 --> 00:56:56,025
No, he's...
You know what, I don't...

837
00:56:57,443 --> 00:56:59,320
Okay then.
Shall we continue?

838
00:57:00,362 --> 00:57:01,947
We can assume
that Bill Fernandez,

839
00:57:02,031 --> 00:57:03,324
Randy Wiggington

840
00:57:03,407 --> 00:57:05,200
and Chris Espinosa will not

841
00:57:05,284 --> 00:57:06,660
be receiving

842
00:57:06,744 --> 00:57:08,287
any Options?

843
00:57:30,977 --> 00:57:32,437
Drinking a beer, huh?

844
00:57:35,607 --> 00:57:37,025
Tomorrow's
a big day for you.

845
00:57:38,276 --> 00:57:39,652
For us.

846
00:57:40,653 --> 00:57:41,946
For us.

847
00:57:43,948 --> 00:57:48,495
Mike told me about what
happened with Bill and Dan

848
00:57:49,871 --> 00:57:54,667
and Chris. And, Steve...

849
00:57:56,712 --> 00:57:57,922
Why'd you do it?

850
00:57:58,172 --> 00:58:00,424
The company outgrew them.

851
00:58:00,508 --> 00:58:03,344
They're not management.
They're not project leads.

852
00:58:04,053 --> 00:58:05,638
It's not my job to
be nice to people.

853
00:58:05,721 --> 00:58:07,306
It's my job to
make them better.

854
00:58:07,723 --> 00:58:09,100
They don't deserve it.

855
00:58:09,183 --> 00:58:11,059
Then who the hell does?

856
00:58:11,142 --> 00:58:12,394
Do you know how
this company works?

857
00:58:13,186 --> 00:58:14,396
Do you want to know?

858
00:58:14,521 --> 00:58:17,148
I'd be happy to teach you,
if you want to know.

859
00:58:19,317 --> 00:58:22,487
Do you know why I started
this company with you?

860
00:58:23,655 --> 00:58:27,742
Why I left the safety
of HP for this?

861
00:58:27,826 --> 00:58:30,538
I doubt you do.
You never asked.

862
00:58:32,665 --> 00:58:34,875
I left because
this was my thing.

863
00:58:35,334 --> 00:58:37,837
And you guys thought
it was cool.

864
00:58:38,504 --> 00:58:41,090
I just wanted to be
one of the guys.

865
00:58:43,843 --> 00:58:49,014
And of all the guys I knew,
you were the coolest.

866
00:58:50,224 --> 00:58:52,685
You were smart,
quick-witted.

867
00:58:53,769 --> 00:58:56,689
And this was my chance
to do what I loved.

868
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:00,526
And to do it for fun.

869
00:59:02,446 --> 00:59:04,865
That's all, that's
all I ever wanted.

870
00:59:05,949 --> 00:59:08,243
I thought that's what
you wanted, too.

871
00:59:12,372 --> 00:59:14,875
Something's happened
to you, Steve.

872
00:59:16,293 --> 00:59:17,961
I'm grown up, Woz.

873
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:23,383
No. No, you're not.

874
00:59:51,036 --> 00:59:53,121
And now, turning to
big news in business,

875
00:59:53,205 --> 00:59:56,041
Apple Incorporated is making
headlines once again.

876
00:59:56,124 --> 00:59:57,751
On Wall Street
the tech titan Apple

877
00:59:57,834 --> 01:00:00,337
went public this morning,
to incredible market interest,

878
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:03,507
as four point six million
shares of its IPO

879
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:05,635
were sold within an hour
of the opening bell.

880
01:00:05,968 --> 01:00:08,095
Wall Street executives
had forecast the big day

881
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:09,680
for the growing
technology company,

882
01:00:09,764 --> 01:00:11,682
but experts now
say Apple's day

883
01:00:11,766 --> 01:00:13,601
exceeded the market's
wildest expectations.

884
01:00:13,935 --> 01:00:15,269
It was the most over...

885
01:00:33,955 --> 01:00:35,706
Hey, hey. Here he is!

886
01:00:36,582 --> 01:00:38,960
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, terrific.

887
01:00:47,635 --> 01:00:49,262
Yeah, you did it.

888
01:00:49,637 --> 01:00:51,097
Let's help them
move that stock.

889
01:00:51,305 --> 01:00:52,515
Hey, pal.

890
01:00:52,932 --> 01:00:54,475
Oh, hey, thank you.

891
01:00:56,978 --> 01:00:58,187
Business as usual, guys.

892
01:01:08,614 --> 01:01:10,117
There's work to
be done, people.

893
01:01:10,534 --> 01:01:14,037
Thank you.
I had some fun ideas.

894
01:01:14,997 --> 01:01:17,040
This is it for me, Bill.
I'll see you when I see you.

895
01:01:17,124 --> 01:01:18,542
I'm gonna get out of here.

896
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:19,835
I'll call you later.

897
01:01:19,918 --> 01:01:21,128
All right.

898
01:01:40,647 --> 01:01:44,068
Hi. Could you please tell
Mr. Markkula we're here. Thank you.

899
01:01:44,152 --> 01:01:45,987
Yes, sir, Mr. Rock.

900
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,285
Gentlemen.

901
01:01:53,368 --> 01:01:55,037
Mike. Please.

902
01:01:57,205 --> 01:01:58,457
Have a seat.

903
01:02:00,584 --> 01:02:01,918
There's something we
need to talk about,

904
01:02:02,002 --> 01:02:04,880
and I don't think
you're gonna like it.

905
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:07,132
It's Steve.

906
01:02:07,215 --> 01:02:09,426
He's hemorrhaging
the company's dollar

907
01:02:09,551 --> 01:02:12,846
on fantasies that simply are not
possible with the Lisa computer.

908
01:02:14,014 --> 01:02:15,975
Yeah, but Steve's been
doing the impossible

909
01:02:16,059 --> 01:02:18,019
ever since this company
was in a garage.

910
01:02:18,436 --> 01:02:21,856
<i>Mike, I love everything
Steve represents. You know that.</i>

911
01:02:22,106 --> 01:02:25,526
But he's like a kid in a candy
store, and we've given him the keys.

912
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:29,072
Yeah.
But, it's his candy store.

913
01:02:29,405 --> 01:02:31,783
You're never gonna see
a personal computer

914
01:02:32,116 --> 01:02:34,327
where the keyboard is attached
to the machine again.

915
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:36,037
Mike, it's a problem.

916
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:39,791
The bigger problem is that
he is ridiculing IBM.

917
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:43,878
Jobs took out a full page ad
in The Wall Street Journal

918
01:02:43,961 --> 01:02:47,216
taunting the biggest computer
company on the planet.

919
01:02:47,758 --> 01:02:50,636
"Congratulations on your
first personal computer. "

920
01:02:50,803 --> 01:02:53,722
He's trying to start
a war with IB fucking M!

921
01:02:54,014 --> 01:02:55,474
I'm fully aware of the ad.

922
01:02:55,557 --> 01:02:56,892
Then do something
about it!

923
01:02:56,975 --> 01:02:59,269
Listen, Arthur,
you know he's right.

924
01:02:59,395 --> 01:03:02,481
Three years ago IBM had no
interest in the personal computer

925
01:03:02,564 --> 01:03:03,857
and now look at 'em!

926
01:03:03,941 --> 01:03:06,234
They followed us.
Think about it.

927
01:03:06,401 --> 01:03:07,610
We have, Mike.

928
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:10,238
And I'm sorry, but the
Board is unanimous.

929
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:13,449
Steve will no longer be involved
in Lisa's development. Period.

930
01:03:14,283 --> 01:03:17,954
What is this, Arthur?
Some sort of power play?

931
01:03:18,454 --> 01:03:20,499
For 18 months now you've
offered nothing but support.

932
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:24,002
And now you want to try and
take Jobs off of his own team?

933
01:03:26,797 --> 01:03:29,258
I don't want
any of this, Mike.

934
01:03:29,842 --> 01:03:31,051
But you have to
try to look at it

935
01:03:31,135 --> 01:03:33,053
from the shareholder's
perspective.

936
01:03:33,137 --> 01:03:34,471
Steve is great.

937
01:03:35,013 --> 01:03:37,099
He's great.
Yeah, he's great.

938
01:03:37,182 --> 01:03:38,642
But he's a time bomb.

939
01:03:39,476 --> 01:03:41,603
And it's our job
to diffuse him.

940
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:44,273
So take care of it.

941
01:03:47,484 --> 01:03:49,695
I don't give a shit
what the Board thinks.

942
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:53,199
It's the time you're taking.
Your perfectionism. It's, it's, it...

943
01:03:53,324 --> 01:03:54,909
They're looking at
losses in the millions

944
01:03:54,993 --> 01:03:56,536
before this thing
even gets off the ground.

945
01:03:58,788 --> 01:04:01,708
They're not seeing
the big picture.

946
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:04,335
That's right. The shareholders
don't see past their own shadows.

947
01:04:04,419 --> 01:04:06,212
They're only concerned
about the here and the now.

948
01:04:06,296 --> 01:04:08,047
And the Board has
got blinders on.

949
01:04:08,173 --> 01:04:09,215
If they could see you
they'd take them off,

950
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:10,550
they'd see you
the way I see you.

951
01:04:10,633 --> 01:04:11,760
The way your
employees see you.

952
01:04:11,843 --> 01:04:13,845
Lisa is my project.

953
01:04:14,804 --> 01:04:15,805
It's mine.

954
01:04:16,389 --> 01:04:19,058
And they're taking
it away from me?

955
01:04:22,644 --> 01:04:24,439
You're letting them
take it away from me.

956
01:04:24,522 --> 01:04:26,941
Bullshit, Steve.
You know that's not true.

957
01:04:30,195 --> 01:04:31,529
Shit.

958
01:04:40,663 --> 01:04:43,541
There are more Apple H's
teaching more subjects

959
01:04:43,625 --> 01:04:45,418
in more schools than
any other computer...

960
01:04:47,337 --> 01:04:50,548
Everything from alphabet
lessons for preschool,

961
01:04:50,632 --> 01:04:53,384
to science programs
for graduate school.

962
01:04:54,052 --> 01:04:56,054
So whatever Brian wants to be,

963
01:04:56,513 --> 01:04:57,807
an Apple personal computer

964
01:04:58,849 --> 01:05:00,643
can help him be it.

965
01:05:01,185 --> 01:05:04,146
<i>The Apple II. There's no telling
how far it can take you.</i>

966
01:05:21,997 --> 01:05:23,415
Now that doesn't
make any sense.

967
01:05:23,499 --> 01:05:27,002
Well, you haven't seen as
much of murder as I have, Mr. Cross.

968
01:05:27,086 --> 01:05:30,549
I'd rather have a judge give me the
works than have to do it myself.

969
01:05:30,924 --> 01:05:32,175
Right here in solitary.

970
01:05:32,259 --> 01:05:33,343
So what?

971
01:05:33,426 --> 01:05:37,012
So you go right on punishing yourself.
You can't get away with it.

972
01:05:41,559 --> 01:05:42,852
Hi, I'm Gabe Kaplan.

973
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:45,521
Take the Pepsi Challenge. Let your
taste decide.

974
01:05:45,688 --> 01:05:48,190
Right, guys? Okay, now
why don't you tell me

975
01:05:48,274 --> 01:05:50,776
which one you chose.
Pepsi Cola.

976
01:05:51,527 --> 01:05:53,279
Yeah?
Hey, Steve. It's Mike.

977
01:05:53,612 --> 01:05:54,697
Hey.

978
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:57,783
Hey. Um, I think I may have
found a project for you.

979
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:59,869
It's more of an R&D
outcast than anything,

980
01:05:59,952 --> 01:06:02,247
but it's actually a project
you approved some time back.

981
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:04,124
Why don't you look into it?

982
01:06:10,463 --> 01:06:12,257
So this is
the Macintosh team.

983
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,466
Mmm-hmm.

984
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,343
Oh, Jesus.

985
01:06:15,427 --> 01:06:17,304
Nope. It's just Steve.

986
01:06:17,804 --> 01:06:19,681
It's really good
to see you, Steve.

987
01:06:20,473 --> 01:06:23,894
Bill Atkinson. It's good to see
they got A players over here.

988
01:06:23,977 --> 01:06:25,812
Mmm-hmm. Hey. Get up.

989
01:06:30,859 --> 01:06:32,444
Hi, Steve Jobs.

990
01:06:32,527 --> 01:06:33,570
What's your name?

991
01:06:33,653 --> 01:06:35,239
Burr...
Burrell Smith.

992
01:06:35,323 --> 01:06:36,574
Burrell Smith.

993
01:06:37,241 --> 01:06:38,284
Oh, sorry for the mess.

994
01:06:38,367 --> 01:06:40,912
We're just a bunch
of degenerates. So...

995
01:06:41,078 --> 01:06:42,496
It's okay.
I like degenerates.

996
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:43,623
Yeah.

997
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:45,583
Who's your project lead?

998
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:47,293
Uh, Jef Raskin...

999
01:06:49,085 --> 01:06:50,795
I don't know where he is.

1000
01:06:50,879 --> 01:06:52,380
Jef Raskin.

1001
01:06:53,715 --> 01:06:57,677
Okay. I'll deal with that one.
I'll be taking over now.

1002
01:06:58,762 --> 01:07:03,725
Um... Sorry, taking over, like,
the entire Macintosh project?

1003
01:07:04,476 --> 01:07:06,228
Yeah.
Awesome.

1004
01:07:08,105 --> 01:07:10,066
Where's your design team?

1005
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,278
Team? I don't...

1006
01:07:15,655 --> 01:07:17,073
Show me
your current build.

1007
01:07:20,034 --> 01:07:22,620
Well, obviously ease of use
is a big feature here.

1008
01:07:22,703 --> 01:07:24,330
We're trying to develop
a simpler interface

1009
01:07:24,413 --> 01:07:27,291
that's geared towards
the real layman end user.

1010
01:07:28,542 --> 01:07:31,837
But, we're kind of struggling with
the interface, and, to be frank...

1011
01:07:31,921 --> 01:07:33,506
The results have been...

1012
01:07:33,923 --> 01:07:35,299
Shit.
Yeah.

1013
01:07:35,383 --> 01:07:36,384
What's it got under the hood?

1014
01:07:37,593 --> 01:07:38,845
Standard kick ass stuff.

1015
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:40,138
Sixty-four K RAM...

1016
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:43,100
Two fifty-six bitmap
display, Motorola 6809.

1017
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:45,644
We're gonna run the 68000.

1018
01:07:45,727 --> 01:07:48,146
But dude,
that's Lisa's processor.

1019
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,565
That's correct. Dude.

1020
01:07:51,483 --> 01:07:53,735
I don't care what the budget is.
Give me their processor.

1021
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,363
Done.

1022
01:07:56,571 --> 01:07:58,156
Hey, Steve.

1023
01:07:58,448 --> 01:07:59,616
How are you, man?

1024
01:08:02,368 --> 01:08:03,452
Chris, it has been a...

1025
01:08:03,536 --> 01:08:04,537
Yep.

1026
01:08:04,787 --> 01:08:06,914
You're working on the Macintosh?
Yeah.

1027
01:08:07,957 --> 01:08:09,208
Good.

1028
01:08:10,001 --> 01:08:11,753
Good, this is
gonna be fun.

1029
01:08:18,802 --> 01:08:21,346
Okay. Let's go back to what
you were saying before.

1030
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,349
This thing is for
the everyman. Right?

1031
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,101
That's our end user.

1032
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:29,354
It's the school teacher.

1033
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,814
It's the garbage man.

1034
01:08:30,897 --> 01:08:35,318
It's the kid. It's some grandma
out in Nebraska. Right?

1035
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:39,239
So we need to make
this thing simple.

1036
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:42,617
It's gotta work like...

1037
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,788
like an appliance.

1038
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:49,709
Hey, Jef.

1039
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,044
Steve Jobs is here.

1040
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:54,338
Since you weren't around...

1041
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:59,218
Some of the project leads were
having a meeting with Motorola.

1042
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:01,512
Why exactly are you here?

1043
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:05,641
I'm here to help
build the Macintosh.

1044
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:09,312
Ah. I'm not sure that
that's practical for us.

1045
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,315
We're actually trying
to avoid this project

1046
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:15,151
becoming another
over bloated disaster.

1047
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:21,991
Okay, Jef.

1048
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,205
You got my attention.

1049
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:31,167
Look, Steve.

1050
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:35,004
You didn't want to be involved
back when we started this thing,

1051
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:37,298
and that was fine by me.

1052
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,926
I just wanted you
to cut the checks.

1053
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,595
Be involved,
just don't turn Macintosh

1054
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:45,181
into a measure of
revenge for you.

1055
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:48,977
Everyone knows about your
fallout with Team Lisa.

1056
01:09:49,061 --> 01:09:53,398
So trust me when I say,
we're doing fine.

1057
01:09:55,609 --> 01:09:57,402
Okay, Jef.

1058
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:01,615
Let's get
a couple things straight.

1059
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:06,912
We don't do fine.

1060
01:10:07,788 --> 01:10:10,249
And we don't accept things
the way that they are,

1061
01:10:10,332 --> 01:10:13,627
and we don't
stop innovating.

1062
01:10:14,962 --> 01:10:17,297
Now, your machine lacks power.

1063
01:10:17,548 --> 01:10:20,050
And your little interface,
it needs work.

1064
01:10:20,134 --> 01:10:21,511
And I'm here
to help with that.

1065
01:10:22,095 --> 01:10:25,765
Now, I'm not trying to take
Macintosh away from you.

1066
01:10:26,057 --> 01:10:28,935
I want you on this team.

1067
01:10:29,227 --> 01:10:33,230
But you can either get on board,
or you can get the fuck out.

1068
01:10:41,405 --> 01:10:44,700
Okay. Now, we've got a lot of work to do.
So, let's get to it.

1069
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:46,243
Bill, you come with me.

1070
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:47,995
Okay. Where are we going?

1071
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:49,121
Recruiting.

1072
01:10:50,205 --> 01:10:51,373
Shit.

1073
01:10:54,711 --> 01:10:55,879
Hey, Steve.
Hold these for a second.

1074
01:10:55,962 --> 01:10:57,422
Yeah.
Thanks.

1075
01:10:57,505 --> 01:10:59,799
What, what's going on?
What are you doing?

1076
01:11:00,842 --> 01:11:02,552
Steve? You're on the
Macintosh Team now.

1077
01:11:02,635 --> 01:11:06,514
What, Ste...
What's a Macintosh?

1078
01:11:09,309 --> 01:11:10,727
Andy Hertzfeld.

1079
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:12,187
Are you good?

1080
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:14,939
I only want good people
working on Macintosh,

1081
01:11:15,398 --> 01:11:17,150
and I'm not sure
if you're good enough.

1082
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:19,360
Excuse me?

1083
01:11:19,444 --> 01:11:21,821
Bill Atkinson says
that you're good.

1084
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,782
I... Yes.
I think I'm pretty good.

1085
01:11:24,908 --> 01:11:25,910
Are you creative?

1086
01:11:25,993 --> 01:11:27,119
I... I... I think so.

1087
01:11:27,203 --> 01:11:29,663
Welcome to the Macintosh Team.

1088
01:11:37,421 --> 01:11:38,881
I'm tired of saving
your ass, kid.

1089
01:11:38,964 --> 01:11:40,299
You love saving my ass.

1090
01:11:40,382 --> 01:11:42,092
I want my own
engineering team.

1091
01:11:42,176 --> 01:11:43,885
You can pick them yourself.

1092
01:11:44,344 --> 01:11:47,555
And I am done
working under the gun

1093
01:11:47,639 --> 01:11:50,808
of your ridiculous
deadline bullshit.

1094
01:11:50,975 --> 01:11:53,478
You might as well be asking
for a date with her.

1095
01:11:53,811 --> 01:11:55,688
I want that, too.

1096
01:11:55,772 --> 01:11:57,065
Done.

1097
01:11:57,148 --> 01:11:58,651
Serious, Steve.

1098
01:12:00,903 --> 01:12:03,489
So what is this, Steve? Some
sort of performance review?

1099
01:12:03,572 --> 01:12:04,657
How are things
going on the IIE?

1100
01:12:05,157 --> 01:12:07,576
Things are great.
Really great.

1101
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:08,911
You're bored to death,
aren't you?

1102
01:12:08,994 --> 01:12:10,412
Yes. Yes I am.

1103
01:12:13,499 --> 01:12:14,833
You want to come work
with me on the Mac Team?

1104
01:12:14,917 --> 01:12:17,670
You're trying to recruit me
for the Mac Team, aren't you?

1105
01:12:17,753 --> 01:12:19,255
Okay, I'm in.

1106
01:12:24,885 --> 01:12:27,763
You've gotta have a problem
that you want to solve.

1107
01:12:27,846 --> 01:12:29,515
A wrong that
you want to right.

1108
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,810
And it's gotta be something
that you're passionate about,

1109
01:12:31,893 --> 01:12:34,854
because otherwise you won't have the
perseverance to see it through.

1110
01:12:35,021 --> 01:12:38,275
I don't ever want to hear you tell
me that you can't make it faster.

1111
01:12:38,358 --> 01:12:40,986
I mean, millions of people
are gonna buy this machine.

1112
01:12:41,069 --> 01:12:43,196
And we can't look
at the competition

1113
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,282
and say we're
gonna do it better.

1114
01:12:45,365 --> 01:12:48,994
We have to look at the competition and
say we're gonna do it differently.

1115
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:53,873
We have an opportunity to build
a revolutionary machine.

1116
01:12:54,165 --> 01:12:56,876
And in your life you only
get to do so many things.

1117
01:12:57,043 --> 01:13:00,504
Right now we've
chosen to do this.

1118
01:13:00,713 --> 01:13:02,757
So let's make it great.

1119
01:13:30,577 --> 01:13:31,745
It's great.

1120
01:13:34,957 --> 01:13:36,876
No. It's not.

1121
01:13:38,127 --> 01:13:39,920
It's insanely great.

1122
01:13:47,762 --> 01:13:49,805
We should try to get more
memory into it if we can.

1123
01:13:51,307 --> 01:13:52,683
We can still hit the timeline.

1124
01:13:54,226 --> 01:13:55,478
Take a look at it.

1125
01:13:56,604 --> 01:13:59,398
This little Macintosh side project
has gotten out of hand, Steve.

1126
01:13:59,482 --> 01:14:00,983
Way beyond the pale.

1127
01:14:01,692 --> 01:14:05,154
First you created a $10,000
monstrosity with Lisa,

1128
01:14:05,237 --> 01:14:07,073
and now you've
poured millions

1129
01:14:07,157 --> 01:14:08,950
into what was supposed
to be a minor diversion.

1130
01:14:09,701 --> 01:14:11,535
You've missed
multiple ship dates,

1131
01:14:11,952 --> 01:14:14,830
and meanwhile, IBM is
just purring along.

1132
01:14:15,331 --> 01:14:16,582
Steve...

1133
01:14:16,665 --> 01:14:19,335
People don't use computers
the way you think they do.

1134
01:14:19,752 --> 01:14:22,421
How are we even supposed
to market the Macintosh?

1135
01:14:22,797 --> 01:14:24,048
We don't.

1136
01:14:25,549 --> 01:14:28,636
You give me five candidates for CEO.
You're gonna let me choose.

1137
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,596
I say we choose someone
with a marketing background

1138
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:32,390
to help us sell
what's never been sold.

1139
01:14:32,765 --> 01:14:36,102
Now, while I would like
to run my own company,

1140
01:14:36,185 --> 01:14:40,649
Mike has helped me understand
that you don't think I'm ready.

1141
01:14:41,358 --> 01:14:42,901
Yes, because you're not.

1142
01:14:42,984 --> 01:14:44,027
Okay.

1143
01:14:44,528 --> 01:14:45,904
I want John Sculley.

1144
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,823
John Sculley?

1145
01:14:47,906 --> 01:14:49,449
President of Pepsi Cola.

1146
01:14:49,533 --> 01:14:50,659
The Pepsi Challenge guy.

1147
01:14:50,867 --> 01:14:53,662
He's smart,
he's a marketing genius

1148
01:14:54,162 --> 01:14:55,831
and he'll do whatever
it takes to succeed.

1149
01:14:56,164 --> 01:14:57,624
Steve, Sculley
is a tough get.

1150
01:14:58,083 --> 01:14:59,459
Maybe the toughest
on our list.

1151
01:15:00,001 --> 01:15:02,379
What the hell makes you
think you can get him?

1152
01:15:04,005 --> 01:15:05,674
Why would he
ever leave Pepsi?

1153
01:15:08,552 --> 01:15:11,847
Nobody remembers the world's
best soda salesman.

1154
01:15:28,864 --> 01:15:30,532
I need somebody I can trust.

1155
01:15:33,785 --> 01:15:36,037
You can make a great product.

1156
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:38,748
But you have to
convince people

1157
01:15:38,832 --> 01:15:41,460
that what you're
selling is greater.

1158
01:15:41,918 --> 01:15:45,590
We're not selling computers.
We're selling what they can do

1159
01:15:46,257 --> 01:15:47,884
with a computer.

1160
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:50,261
A tool for the mind.

1161
01:15:51,888 --> 01:15:54,557
And that,
ladies and gentlemen,

1162
01:15:55,266 --> 01:15:57,018
is limitless.

1163
01:15:57,685 --> 01:15:59,645
Because people will
never stop believing

1164
01:15:59,729 --> 01:16:01,689
that they could get
more out of something,

1165
01:16:02,398 --> 01:16:06,235
whether it be their jobs,
their marriage, their money,

1166
01:16:06,402 --> 01:16:08,196
their lives.

1167
01:16:08,279 --> 01:16:10,531
That's what you have
to do with the Mac.

1168
01:16:11,073 --> 01:16:13,242
It's the belief
in the limitless.

1169
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:15,912
The impossible.

1170
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:19,750
That no matter what you
dream, you can do it.

1171
01:16:20,626 --> 01:16:22,461
And Mac will
help you get there.

1172
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:26,632
A few months ago, when Steve
was visiting me in Manhattan,

1173
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:29,801
he asked me a very important question.
He said,

1174
01:16:31,261 --> 01:16:33,514
"Do you want to sell sugar water
for the rest of your life,

1175
01:16:33,597 --> 01:16:37,684
"or come with me,
and change the world?"

1176
01:16:41,437 --> 01:16:42,772
Well,

1177
01:16:43,731 --> 01:16:46,484
here I am. Thank you.

1178
01:17:09,967 --> 01:17:13,136
It is now 1984.

1179
01:17:13,637 --> 01:17:17,558
It appears IBM wants it all.

1180
01:17:18,267 --> 01:17:20,852
Apple is perceived
to be the only hope

1181
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:23,481
to offer IBM
a run for its money.

1182
01:17:23,982 --> 01:17:28,278
Will Big Blue dominate the
entire computer industry?

1183
01:17:28,611 --> 01:17:29,654
No!

1184
01:17:30,321 --> 01:17:32,657
The entire information age?

1185
01:17:33,157 --> 01:17:34,158
No!

1186
01:17:34,909 --> 01:17:39,497
Was George Orwell
right about 1984?

1187
01:17:40,248 --> 01:17:41,916
No!

1188
01:17:42,292 --> 01:17:43,918
Today we celebrate the first

1189
01:17:44,502 --> 01:17:48,506
glorious anniversary of the
Information Purification Directives.

1190
01:17:51,092 --> 01:17:52,510
For the first time
in all history,

1191
01:17:53,176 --> 01:17:56,180
a garden of pure ideology,

1192
01:17:56,514 --> 01:17:58,683
where each worker may bloom,

1193
01:17:58,766 --> 01:18:00,685
secure from the pests.

1194
01:18:00,852 --> 01:18:03,187
Our enemies shall
talk themselves to death.

1195
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,195
First time in all history.

1196
01:18:12,697 --> 01:18:14,032
We shall...

1197
01:18:14,699 --> 01:18:15,992
prevail.

1198
01:18:17,327 --> 01:18:21,623
On January 24th, Apple Computer
will introduce Macintosh

1199
01:18:21,873 --> 01:18:27,004
and you'll see why 1984
won't be like 1984.

1200
01:18:59,663 --> 01:19:00,955
Good work.

1201
01:19:08,253 --> 01:19:09,838
Some response, huh?
I can't believe it.

1202
01:19:09,922 --> 01:19:11,131
It's a revolution.
It's a revolution.

1203
01:19:11,256 --> 01:19:12,508
The thing's
a game changer.

1204
01:19:12,591 --> 01:19:14,468
You really outdid
yourself, Steve.

1205
01:19:14,551 --> 01:19:17,596
Hey. Why don't you
give me a call?

1206
01:19:18,639 --> 01:19:20,391
Grab some dinner or something.
Yeah.

1207
01:19:20,474 --> 01:19:22,434
Okay.
I'd like that.

1208
01:19:23,143 --> 01:19:24,478
Steve.
Arthur.

1209
01:19:24,603 --> 01:19:25,688
Great job up there.

1210
01:19:25,771 --> 01:19:26,939
Thank you.

1211
01:19:28,023 --> 01:19:31,194
Steve, I want you to know
that we believe in you.

1212
01:19:32,654 --> 01:19:34,114
I hope you know that.

1213
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:37,283
Thank you, Arthur.

1214
01:19:47,669 --> 01:19:48,878
Hey.

1215
01:19:49,462 --> 01:19:50,463
What was that?

1216
01:19:51,089 --> 01:19:52,173
What...

1217
01:19:52,257 --> 01:19:53,341
Rock. He just...

1218
01:19:54,467 --> 01:19:55,969
Said something,
"we believe in you. "

1219
01:19:56,803 --> 01:19:58,638
What's going on?

1220
01:19:58,972 --> 01:20:00,223
It's the Macintosh.

1221
01:20:00,306 --> 01:20:01,808
You know, we had
them run the numbers

1222
01:20:01,891 --> 01:20:03,310
100 different ways,
100 times over...

1223
01:20:03,436 --> 01:20:05,229
- You're marking up the Macintosh.
- Yep.

1224
01:20:05,312 --> 01:20:08,315
If we keep it as is, we'll be
hemorrhaging money by launch date.

1225
01:20:12,027 --> 01:20:13,988
You're gonna price out
the consumer.

1226
01:20:14,321 --> 01:20:15,906
Well, we can't take the risk
of flattening our profits.

1227
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:17,074
No.

1228
01:20:17,158 --> 01:20:18,617
We can't have it both ways.

1229
01:20:18,701 --> 01:20:21,244
I mean, you insisted on the
most expensive hardware.

1230
01:20:21,327 --> 01:20:22,912
The Mac was originally
much cheaper.

1231
01:20:22,996 --> 01:20:25,915
Jef Raskin
designed a $1,000 box.

1232
01:20:25,999 --> 01:20:27,292
I made it great.

1233
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:29,252
If you want the company
to remain profitable...

1234
01:20:29,335 --> 01:20:30,837
Whose idea was this?

1235
01:20:36,177 --> 01:20:37,553
It's a group decision.

1236
01:20:38,846 --> 01:20:40,723
Whose idea was this?

1237
01:20:43,392 --> 01:20:47,772
It was mine. Not Michael's,
not the Board. It was me.

1238
01:20:50,566 --> 01:20:54,653
We don't do this, John.
IBM does this shit.

1239
01:20:54,737 --> 01:20:56,655
Steve...
Not Apple. Not me.

1240
01:20:56,739 --> 01:20:58,407
Look, don't make me
the villain because

1241
01:20:58,491 --> 01:21:00,826
I'm looking out for our
company's best interests.

1242
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:02,161
Steve.

1243
01:21:04,538 --> 01:21:06,457
Some things have to change.

1244
01:21:09,795 --> 01:21:12,339
If you keep heading
down this path,

1245
01:21:13,006 --> 01:21:14,883
I will not be able
to protect you.

1246
01:21:17,177 --> 01:21:18,887
They got to you.

1247
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,686
They?

1248
01:21:53,129 --> 01:21:54,506
How'd you get this?

1249
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:59,678
Arrived yesterday. It's pre-beta,
obviously, but it's all...

1250
01:21:59,761 --> 01:22:01,638
It's a blatant rip-off.

1251
01:22:11,314 --> 01:22:13,734
Get me Bill Gates
on the phone.

1252
01:22:14,193 --> 01:22:18,197
Let me make this
perfectly clear, Bill.

1253
01:22:18,739 --> 01:22:23,703
So that when I'm finished, you
can still see through those

1254
01:22:23,786 --> 01:22:28,457
thick pretentious glasses, you
psychopathic, unimaginative criminal.

1255
01:22:31,544 --> 01:22:33,342
You stole...

1256
01:22:34,577 --> 01:22:38,883
my software,
and I can prove it in court.

1257
01:22:38,968 --> 01:22:43,806
And I'm gonna sue you for every
cent that you have ever made.

1258
01:22:44,223 --> 01:22:48,395
And I will make it my life's mission
to see to it that you never,

1259
01:22:48,854 --> 01:22:49,937
never,

1260
01:22:50,021 --> 01:22:53,983
ever make another dollar that
I don't first take 90 cents.

1261
01:22:57,194 --> 01:23:00,615
I can only assume that you
are all as irate as I am,

1262
01:23:00,698 --> 01:23:03,868
and you're simply
too dumbfounded to speak.

1263
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,662
Mr. Jobs promised
us a million units.

1264
01:23:06,829 --> 01:23:08,497
We have yet to reach
a quarter of that.

1265
01:23:08,748 --> 01:23:10,374
Something has to change.

1266
01:23:10,666 --> 01:23:13,794
With two failed projects,
overextended R&Ds,

1267
01:23:13,878 --> 01:23:15,254
and that Microsoft fiasco,

1268
01:23:15,546 --> 01:23:18,717
we're about to experience the first
quarterly loss in company history.

1269
01:23:19,051 --> 01:23:21,011
IBM beat us to market
by two years

1270
01:23:21,094 --> 01:23:23,388
with a better product
and better sales.

1271
01:23:23,513 --> 01:23:26,516
The Macintosh is not even a toy.
It's a joke.

1272
01:23:27,017 --> 01:23:29,519
IBM has now moved
on to mini decks.

1273
01:23:30,228 --> 01:23:31,688
And so should we.

1274
01:23:33,523 --> 01:23:35,734
What are you
getting at, Arthur?

1275
01:23:36,568 --> 01:23:39,321
Gentlemen, I believe
it's time to reconsider

1276
01:23:39,404 --> 01:23:42,115
the viability of
the personal computer.

1277
01:23:46,078 --> 01:23:48,038
Steve, anything to say?

1278
01:23:52,085 --> 01:23:53,795
What would you
have me say, Arthur?

1279
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:56,714
You raised our price.

1280
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,217
Don't put that on me.

1281
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:03,011
The problem is not the price, Steve.
It's your product.

1282
01:24:03,387 --> 01:24:04,805
You over-hyped the Mac.

1283
01:24:04,972 --> 01:24:08,934
You told people to wait. You sold
the future of the Macintosh.

1284
01:24:09,601 --> 01:24:11,770
And as a result we lost
two years of sales.

1285
01:24:11,853 --> 01:24:13,188
It's not my fault.

1286
01:24:13,271 --> 01:24:15,232
Well, it sure as shit
is somebody's fault.

1287
01:24:15,399 --> 01:24:17,067
Well, I'm not
receiving any support.

1288
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:19,987
You're stripping
me of my resources,

1289
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:21,738
and dumping millions
into the Apple ll.

1290
01:24:21,822 --> 01:24:24,534
Do you know why we keep dumping
millions into the Apple ll?

1291
01:24:24,617 --> 01:24:29,580
Because it sells. It's 70% of our revenue.
How's the Mac doing?

1292
01:24:29,664 --> 01:24:32,375
I made my opinion
perfectly clear.

1293
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:36,087
If you want to keep sucking on the
tailpipe of IBM, then I can't stop you.

1294
01:24:36,295 --> 01:24:40,049
But I will not take the blame for
the failures of some court jester.

1295
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,010
All right,
this is crazy, Steve...

1296
01:24:42,093 --> 01:24:44,929
No. No, no. To whom are
you referring, Steve?

1297
01:24:45,596 --> 01:24:47,181
I don't know, Arthur.

1298
01:24:47,306 --> 01:24:48,850
You tell me.

1299
01:24:53,938 --> 01:24:56,108
John, you're awfully quiet.

1300
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:00,738
Yeah. I'm sorry.

1301
01:25:02,865 --> 01:25:04,783
I guess I'm just
at a loss for words.

1302
01:25:05,993 --> 01:25:09,163
Head of marketing.
Pepsi genius.

1303
01:25:09,496 --> 01:25:11,123
Loss for words.

1304
01:25:11,874 --> 01:25:15,127
It's him. Not the Mac.

1305
01:25:18,296 --> 01:25:19,922
But the cost of that process...

1306
01:25:26,345 --> 01:25:30,684
$10,000 price tag.
That price tag...

1307
01:25:38,442 --> 01:25:40,486
Goes against him,
and not against Mac.

1308
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:43,030
It's ironic, isn't it?

1309
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,827
You chose Dylan, I chose,
I chose The Beatles.

1310
01:25:48,911 --> 01:25:50,788
Seems so backward now.

1311
01:25:50,871 --> 01:25:51,997
Woz.

1312
01:25:52,748 --> 01:25:54,416
What are you doing here?

1313
01:25:56,043 --> 01:25:57,753
Good to see you,
too, Steve.

1314
01:25:57,836 --> 01:26:00,340
I'm... I'm a little bit busy.

1315
01:26:01,007 --> 01:26:03,093
Just, do you mind
if we talk later?

1316
01:26:03,176 --> 01:26:06,221
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. This'll
only take a minute.

1317
01:26:07,972 --> 01:26:09,182
I, uh...

1318
01:26:09,891 --> 01:26:11,726
I'm leaving, Steve.

1319
01:26:13,019 --> 01:26:14,229
Okay.

1320
01:26:15,355 --> 01:26:17,190
No. No, Steve.

1321
01:26:19,025 --> 01:26:20,485
I'm leaving Apple.

1322
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:25,323
For good. Actually,
I already did. I just...

1323
01:26:26,032 --> 01:26:28,952
I thought I should come
back and tell you first.

1324
01:26:29,828 --> 01:26:31,120
Why?

1325
01:26:35,125 --> 01:26:38,878
We both knew this was coming
for some time. I don't even...

1326
01:26:38,962 --> 01:26:41,464
I don't even remember
the last time we talked.

1327
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,301
What do you want
from me, then?

1328
01:26:47,387 --> 01:26:49,556
Not everyone has
an agenda, Steve.

1329
01:26:51,558 --> 01:26:52,851
Right.

1330
01:26:56,271 --> 01:26:59,732
You know, I can still remember
when we were just kids,

1331
01:27:00,567 --> 01:27:02,360
back in your dad's garage.

1332
01:27:04,572 --> 01:27:05,823
And we just wanted to

1333
01:27:05,906 --> 01:27:09,535
create cool toys for people like us.
You remember that?

1334
01:27:10,911 --> 01:27:12,121
Yeah.

1335
01:27:12,538 --> 01:27:15,583
Now it's not about
people anymore for you.

1336
01:27:15,708 --> 01:27:17,960
No, it's about the product.

1337
01:27:19,378 --> 01:27:21,255
Worst of all, it's...

1338
01:27:23,007 --> 01:27:24,258
It's about yourself.

1339
01:27:25,885 --> 01:27:29,513
You're the beginning and end
of your own world, Steve.

1340
01:27:31,432 --> 01:27:35,853
And it's so small. So sad.

1341
01:27:38,231 --> 01:27:41,651
And it's...
it's gotta be lonely.

1342
01:27:43,445 --> 01:27:45,779
And I know you're gonna say

1343
01:27:46,447 --> 01:27:48,782
that the product
and the person

1344
01:27:48,866 --> 01:27:51,118
need to be connected
and all that,

1345
01:27:51,202 --> 01:27:55,080
but it will never be
what you think it will.

1346
01:27:56,498 --> 01:27:58,292
It just won't.

1347
01:27:59,293 --> 01:28:02,087
No, not, not for
a long time at least.

1348
01:28:03,589 --> 01:28:07,343
I don't know what you think
is going on, Steve, but I do.

1349
01:28:07,843 --> 01:28:10,263
And it doesn't
end well for you.

1350
01:28:12,849 --> 01:28:14,851
And I'm not...

1351
01:28:16,186 --> 01:28:18,772
I'm not sticking
around to watch.

1352
01:28:22,567 --> 01:28:24,569
It's been a journey.

1353
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:30,992
And for the record,

1354
01:28:35,038 --> 01:28:36,790
I love what we did.

1355
01:29:32,638 --> 01:29:35,975
Hi. You've reached John Sculley.
Please leave a message.

1356
01:29:36,726 --> 01:29:39,395
Hey, John. It's Steve.

1357
01:29:40,021 --> 01:29:41,188
Uh...

1358
01:29:41,397 --> 01:29:42,857
I just...

1359
01:29:47,487 --> 01:29:50,365
We're still partners,
John, you and I.

1360
01:29:51,074 --> 01:29:53,243
We are, we're in
this together.

1361
01:29:53,410 --> 01:29:54,870
And I, um...

1362
01:29:58,749 --> 01:30:01,668
You just give me a call back?
That'd be great. Um...

1363
01:30:13,554 --> 01:30:15,556
Hey, Mike. It's Steve.

1364
01:30:18,267 --> 01:30:20,645
Would you give
me a call back?

1365
01:30:22,439 --> 01:30:23,774
Please?

1366
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:34,326
John, you have to
take control now.

1367
01:30:34,451 --> 01:30:37,245
Do you have any idea how close
our shareholders are to a panic?

1368
01:30:37,329 --> 01:30:39,790
The implications
of your inaction?

1369
01:30:40,832 --> 01:30:44,127
Forget your job, the entire
company is at stake here.

1370
01:30:44,252 --> 01:30:45,670
This could ruin everyone.

1371
01:30:45,921 --> 01:30:48,256
I know, Arthur, but I still think
that we can salvage this.

1372
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:50,467
Can't salvage anything.

1373
01:30:50,968 --> 01:30:52,178
I doubt...

1374
01:30:52,261 --> 01:30:53,554
Steve.

1375
01:30:55,139 --> 01:30:56,140
Mike.

1376
01:30:56,682 --> 01:30:57,892
John.

1377
01:30:57,975 --> 01:30:58,976
Steve.

1378
01:30:59,143 --> 01:31:00,645
Arthur.

1379
01:31:01,145 --> 01:31:02,897
What the hell are you
doing here so early?

1380
01:31:03,606 --> 01:31:05,858
I could ask you
the same question.

1381
01:31:07,276 --> 01:31:08,945
This is good.

1382
01:31:09,028 --> 01:31:12,448
Steve, why don't you join us this time?
Have a seat.

1383
01:31:12,657 --> 01:31:13,866
This time?

1384
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:16,160
Steve, have a seat.

1385
01:31:24,837 --> 01:31:26,004
John?

1386
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,382
Arthur, I don't want to. Yes.

1387
01:31:29,715 --> 01:31:32,677
You do. Say it.

1388
01:31:44,981 --> 01:31:47,108
Tell him what
you've told me.

1389
01:31:51,612 --> 01:31:55,199
I find it increasingly
difficult to do my job

1390
01:31:57,202 --> 01:32:00,205
when the greatest
obstacle in my path

1391
01:32:01,832 --> 01:32:04,543
casts a looming shadow over
everything I try to do.

1392
01:32:12,217 --> 01:32:13,385
What did you say?

1393
01:32:14,928 --> 01:32:16,430
Steve...

1394
01:32:18,682 --> 01:32:20,809
You are your own worst enemy.

1395
01:32:23,604 --> 01:32:26,064
And this company's.

1396
01:32:32,864 --> 01:32:35,241
This... It's unbelievable.

1397
01:32:36,576 --> 01:32:38,661
Who do you think you are?

1398
01:32:43,916 --> 01:32:46,752
I'm CEO of Apple Computer.

1399
01:32:53,175 --> 01:32:54,551
Hiring you

1400
01:32:55,177 --> 01:32:59,765
was the worst mistake
I have ever made.

1401
01:33:03,728 --> 01:33:05,647
Steve, it doesn't
have to be this way.

1402
01:33:11,236 --> 01:33:12,779
Okay. That's done.

1403
01:33:13,613 --> 01:33:15,698
Boards don't run companies.

1404
01:33:15,865 --> 01:33:19,202
The people who create the
product run the company.

1405
01:33:19,285 --> 01:33:21,704
He has the nerve to tell me
we should have used the 512.

1406
01:33:21,788 --> 01:33:23,039
We told them that
it needed a 512.

1407
01:33:23,122 --> 01:33:25,041
We said not to use the 128.

1408
01:33:25,124 --> 01:33:28,378
We knew 128 kilobytes wasn't gonna
get it done when we built it.

1409
01:33:28,461 --> 01:33:30,713
Sculley is leaving
for China tonight.

1410
01:33:30,797 --> 01:33:33,050
He's gonna be there for
a week, so we got time.

1411
01:33:33,133 --> 01:33:34,426
We just gotta recruit.

1412
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:36,053
Steve, Sculley's
gonna find out.

1413
01:33:36,136 --> 01:33:38,389
And then what happens,
you know?

1414
01:33:38,472 --> 01:33:39,890
He's the CEO of
the company now.

1415
01:33:39,974 --> 01:33:41,100
Well, for now.

1416
01:33:41,183 --> 01:33:43,727
But we have the people
who make Apple.

1417
01:33:44,895 --> 01:33:45,980
Oh, hey, Mike.

1418
01:33:46,272 --> 01:33:48,274
We're just getting started.

1419
01:33:51,652 --> 01:33:53,737
Guys, give us a second.

1420
01:33:59,659 --> 01:34:00,952
John's canceled his trip.

1421
01:34:02,745 --> 01:34:06,500
He's having an executive staff
meeting first thing tomorrow.

1422
01:34:10,004 --> 01:34:13,173
So I didn't come to join your revolution.
I came to warn you.

1423
01:34:14,758 --> 01:34:16,427
He wants to make
absolutely sure

1424
01:34:16,510 --> 01:34:18,345
you're nothing more
than a figurehead.

1425
01:34:19,805 --> 01:34:21,390
No power, no title.

1426
01:34:21,932 --> 01:34:23,142
No team.

1427
01:34:30,024 --> 01:34:35,237
I remember thinking when we first
met, um, that you were remarkable.

1428
01:34:36,697 --> 01:34:39,117
You wanted to do
something truly great.

1429
01:34:40,452 --> 01:34:42,078
And I did, too.

1430
01:34:43,163 --> 01:34:44,831
I still do.

1431
01:34:45,874 --> 01:34:50,086
Raise the white flag. Concede to Sculley.
I'm begging you.

1432
01:34:50,545 --> 01:34:51,588
No.

1433
01:34:52,005 --> 01:34:53,298
You can't win this one.

1434
01:34:53,381 --> 01:34:56,217
Whose side are
you on, Mike?

1435
01:34:57,010 --> 01:34:58,720
Because there are sides now.

1436
01:34:58,803 --> 01:35:01,556
And you're either with me
or you're against me.

1437
01:35:04,184 --> 01:35:06,144
Are you with me, Mike?

1438
01:35:08,355 --> 01:35:11,191
Yes, Steve. I'm with you.

1439
01:35:12,817 --> 01:35:13,902
Okay.

1440
01:35:16,738 --> 01:35:17,906
Okay.

1441
01:35:25,747 --> 01:35:28,208
Those in favor
of John Sculley.

1442
01:35:42,556 --> 01:35:44,934
All in favor
of Steve Jobs.

1443
01:35:56,612 --> 01:35:57,905
Mike.

1444
01:35:57,988 --> 01:36:01,075
Every Board member's vote
must be accounted for.

1445
01:36:09,125 --> 01:36:10,418
Mike?

1446
01:36:18,427 --> 01:36:19,678
Sculley.

1447
01:36:23,889 --> 01:36:25,641
I vote for Sculley.

1448
01:36:59,176 --> 01:37:03,555
So, now what do we do?

1449
01:39:16,189 --> 01:39:18,817
Apple's market value has eroded
in the past several years,

1450
01:39:18,901 --> 01:39:22,571
which led to the ousting of former
chief John Sculley in 1993.

1451
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:28,619
Ed Woolard,
former CEO of DuPont,

1452
01:39:28,702 --> 01:39:30,538
<i>has joined Apple as
Chairman of the Board.</i>

1453
01:39:32,415 --> 01:39:36,044
New CEO Gil Amelio says
sweeping changes are necessary.

1454
01:39:37,962 --> 01:39:41,424
Jobs' computer software company
NEXT, has entered into buyout talks

1455
01:39:41,507 --> 01:39:43,426
with his former company,
Apple Computer.

1456
01:40:23,091 --> 01:40:26,386
Hey, will you wake up Lisa and
see if she wants breakfast?

1457
01:40:26,844 --> 01:40:28,054
Yeah.

1458
01:40:30,556 --> 01:40:31,849
Lisa?

1459
01:40:34,228 --> 01:40:36,438
Lisa? Come on.

1460
01:40:36,855 --> 01:40:39,066
Are you gonna
sleep all day, huh?

1461
01:40:39,358 --> 01:40:40,818
Oh, go away.

1462
01:40:40,901 --> 01:40:43,570
Why? I say all day
because it's 10:00.

1463
01:40:44,279 --> 01:40:45,531
Laurene made you breakfast.

1464
01:40:45,864 --> 01:40:47,574
I'm not hungry.

1465
01:40:48,325 --> 01:40:51,578
Well, you can't sleep
all winter break.

1466
01:40:52,037 --> 01:40:53,247
Yes, I can.

1467
01:41:02,881 --> 01:41:04,466
Reed!Reed!

1468
01:41:05,342 --> 01:41:07,929
Can we not run in the garden?
Please?

1469
01:41:09,389 --> 01:41:11,224
Thank you.

1470
01:41:13,309 --> 01:41:14,978
Were you able
to get Lisa up?

1471
01:41:17,355 --> 01:41:22,693
Well, how can a human
being sleep that much?

1472
01:41:25,529 --> 01:41:28,699
She... I don't know
if she's coming or not.

1473
01:41:29,575 --> 01:41:33,787
I'm going to the farmer's market today.
Just gonna get a few things.

1474
01:41:34,455 --> 01:41:36,165
You have any plans?
You want to come with me?

1475
01:41:42,464 --> 01:41:43,673
Hmm?

1476
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,592
I said do you have plans?

1477
01:41:45,675 --> 01:41:46,718
Today?

1478
01:41:47,218 --> 01:41:51,139
Well, Gil Amelio
is gonna stop by.

1479
01:41:53,016 --> 01:41:55,685
They're transitioning in
some of our software.

1480
01:41:59,064 --> 01:42:00,231
Okay.

1481
01:42:01,649 --> 01:42:05,111
I'm... I'm just helping them out.
They just need a little help.

1482
01:42:09,491 --> 01:42:10,826
Oh, boy.

1483
01:42:12,119 --> 01:42:14,121
I'm in trouble,
aren't I?

1484
01:42:15,164 --> 01:42:18,334
Steve, what can I do to
convince you to come back?

1485
01:42:18,417 --> 01:42:19,668
What can you do
to convince me

1486
01:42:19,752 --> 01:42:22,713
I wouldn't be boarding
the Titanic, Gil?

1487
01:42:24,298 --> 01:42:29,720
Because I know how you feel about Apple.
What NEXT could never be.

1488
01:42:31,263 --> 01:42:33,556
Plus, you know, considering
that you now own

1489
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:35,809
a million and a half
shares of Apple,

1490
01:42:35,892 --> 01:42:38,895
I mean, that's
a tangible investment, too.

1491
01:42:39,562 --> 01:42:41,481
You guys must be
pretty desperate.

1492
01:42:42,732 --> 01:42:44,443
We're not desperate.

1493
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:48,197
How are things going
with the Newton?

1494
01:42:48,948 --> 01:42:51,492
Look, don't blame me for the
failures of the last regime.

1495
01:42:51,575 --> 01:42:53,536
It's not as bad
as you think.

1496
01:42:54,787 --> 01:42:57,123
You're overseeing
massive layoffs.

1497
01:42:57,206 --> 01:42:59,416
Apple stock just set
another record low.

1498
01:43:00,126 --> 01:43:03,129
And you're four months
from insolvency, Gil.

1499
01:43:03,462 --> 01:43:04,839
I'd say that's pretty bad.

1500
01:43:05,464 --> 01:43:07,591
Well, yeah. In order
to fix what's broken,

1501
01:43:07,675 --> 01:43:09,885
some sacrifices
are necessary. All right?

1502
01:43:09,969 --> 01:43:12,638
Steve, what do you need?

1503
01:43:13,514 --> 01:43:14,557
Name it.

1504
01:43:37,747 --> 01:43:39,457
Steve.
Gil.

1505
01:43:42,544 --> 01:43:43,545
Steve.

1506
01:43:44,754 --> 01:43:45,881
Mike.

1507
01:43:46,255 --> 01:43:47,756
It's nice to see you.

1508
01:43:54,514 --> 01:43:55,849
Come on,
I'll show you around.

1509
01:43:55,932 --> 01:43:58,143
No, Gil, don't worry about it.
I'll give him the tour.

1510
01:43:58,560 --> 01:43:59,561
You sure?

1511
01:43:59,644 --> 01:44:02,105
Yeah, sure.
No problem. Come on.

1512
01:44:02,189 --> 01:44:03,690
That's great.

1513
01:44:05,192 --> 01:44:06,902
You guys go ahead. I'll...

1514
01:44:08,278 --> 01:44:09,946
I'll catch up.

1515
01:44:11,615 --> 01:44:13,783
There's something I always
wanted you to know, Steve.

1516
01:44:15,785 --> 01:44:17,537
It was never my call.

1517
01:44:17,913 --> 01:44:19,164
Let's not do this, Mike.

1518
01:44:19,247 --> 01:44:22,376
No, this is important.
You know, I tried.

1519
01:44:24,128 --> 01:44:26,589
I wanted you here.
I always did.

1520
01:44:27,006 --> 01:44:30,092
It's too bad it took me
so long to get you back.

1521
01:44:30,801 --> 01:44:32,178
Oh, I'm not back.

1522
01:44:32,970 --> 01:44:34,805
Yeah.
You will be.

1523
01:44:35,514 --> 01:44:36,724
We'll see about that.

1524
01:44:36,807 --> 01:44:41,771
You know, I'm gonna show myself around.
I'll take it from here.

1525
01:44:47,068 --> 01:44:48,611
Son of a bitch.

1526
01:45:26,024 --> 01:45:27,567
Who did these?

1527
01:45:28,819 --> 01:45:30,404
I did, sir.

1528
01:45:35,075 --> 01:45:36,159
Who are you?

1529
01:45:37,077 --> 01:45:40,330
Jonathan Ive. I'm Director
of Industrial Design.

1530
01:45:42,291 --> 01:45:44,042
Why are you still here?

1531
01:45:45,377 --> 01:45:47,129
It's 11:00 a. m. on a Monday.

1532
01:45:47,379 --> 01:45:48,422
No.

1533
01:45:48,964 --> 01:45:53,218
Why are you
still here at Apple?

1534
01:45:54,094 --> 01:45:56,430
This isn't
the company I built.

1535
01:45:56,513 --> 01:45:59,350
There's no taste, no style.

1536
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:02,020
No design.

1537
01:46:02,228 --> 01:46:06,399
So unless they're shackling
you here, why do you stay?

1538
01:46:10,153 --> 01:46:14,489
Well, sir, I guess I would
say there are still

1539
01:46:14,573 --> 01:46:16,616
those of us that believe
in what Apple stood for.

1540
01:46:18,535 --> 01:46:19,911
What you stood for.

1541
01:46:20,912 --> 01:46:22,789
What do you think
I stood for?

1542
01:46:24,583 --> 01:46:26,043
I think...

1543
01:46:28,712 --> 01:46:32,008
I think you believe
that the computer,

1544
01:46:32,091 --> 01:46:35,386
or the Walkman,
or whatever it may be,

1545
01:46:36,054 --> 01:46:38,806
should be a natural extension
of the individual.

1546
01:46:39,766 --> 01:46:41,768
And it's that mission,

1547
01:46:42,018 --> 01:46:47,398
that devotion to quality,
and ideals, and heart...

1548
01:46:49,609 --> 01:46:53,946
That's what keeps us here.
That we might do it once more.

1549
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:27,147
Okay. Whatever
you're working on,

1550
01:47:27,815 --> 01:47:29,565
the rest of the day
I want you to forget it.

1551
01:47:31,609 --> 01:47:34,571
I want everyone to
design something new.

1552
01:47:35,197 --> 01:47:37,282
I don't care what it is, I
don't care if it's technology,

1553
01:47:37,366 --> 01:47:39,910
just create something.

1554
01:47:41,995 --> 01:47:43,580
Something useful.

1555
01:47:44,581 --> 01:47:45,999
Something you care about.

1556
01:47:54,925 --> 01:47:56,009
Steve.

1557
01:47:58,637 --> 01:48:00,514
We're glad you're back.

1558
01:48:02,182 --> 01:48:03,684
I'm not back.

1559
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:09,274
Yet.

1560
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:23,413
Steve.

1561
01:48:29,002 --> 01:48:30,503
Ugh!

1562
01:48:31,921 --> 01:48:33,089
Junk.

1563
01:48:33,173 --> 01:48:35,258
Steve, you met
our Chairman, Ed Woolard.

1564
01:48:35,592 --> 01:48:37,302
Steve.
Hi.

1565
01:48:40,931 --> 01:48:42,098
Look, um...

1566
01:48:42,265 --> 01:48:45,185
I know all about the bad
blood you must taste.

1567
01:48:45,268 --> 01:48:50,607
And I understand your hesitation to
trust me. But I just want you to know

1568
01:48:51,399 --> 01:48:54,819
lam not Arthur Rock.
I'm your friend.

1569
01:48:56,863 --> 01:48:57,947
Okay.

1570
01:48:59,491 --> 01:49:02,076
So, can we take
a minute to talk?

1571
01:49:02,785 --> 01:49:03,786
Apparently.

1572
01:49:03,995 --> 01:49:05,038
Today's paper.

1573
01:49:05,705 --> 01:49:07,832
I'm sure you've
seen the news.

1574
01:49:08,666 --> 01:49:10,919
I'm sorry, Ed, you're gonna
have to be more specific.

1575
01:49:11,336 --> 01:49:15,674
Our shares dropped
7.5% overnight.

1576
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:18,260
It's the lowest
it's been in 10 years.

1577
01:49:18,511 --> 01:49:21,096
Last week
an unidentified investor

1578
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:23,933
dropped one point five
million shares.

1579
01:49:25,309 --> 01:49:28,229
Put a real scare into
the marketplace, Steve.

1580
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:32,024
One point five
million shares? Wow.

1581
01:49:34,193 --> 01:49:37,112
I guess the stockholders
must be getting restless.

1582
01:49:39,073 --> 01:49:40,658
We want you here, Steve.

1583
01:49:41,116 --> 01:49:43,577
I'm here.
As a consultant.

1584
01:49:44,079 --> 01:49:45,580
As CEO.

1585
01:49:47,749 --> 01:49:49,000
CEO?
Yeah.

1586
01:49:49,084 --> 01:49:50,418
At least in the interim.

1587
01:49:51,586 --> 01:49:52,754
And Gil?

1588
01:49:52,837 --> 01:49:54,798
Yeah, well, Gil's halfway
out the door.

1589
01:49:55,173 --> 01:49:57,424
He has to see
the writing on the wall.

1590
01:49:57,508 --> 01:49:59,718
At least if he's not
too proud to admit it.

1591
01:49:59,802 --> 01:50:03,889
Oh, he's going to try to force you
out, and make a case against you.

1592
01:50:03,973 --> 01:50:06,016
Where have I
seen this before?

1593
01:50:06,684 --> 01:50:08,769
Gil's on the ledge. He
doesn't have a play here.

1594
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:11,355
All we need is
a little push from you.

1595
01:50:11,689 --> 01:50:14,316
If you want to get back what
you lost, this is the time.

1596
01:50:16,695 --> 01:50:20,448
I never lost it.
It was stolen from me.

1597
01:50:27,706 --> 01:50:31,501
There's no sex left in computers.
No curves.

1598
01:50:32,627 --> 01:50:35,755
Now, if computers are
for art, and beauty,

1599
01:50:35,839 --> 01:50:39,050
and global interconnectivity,
why are they so ugly?

1600
01:50:40,093 --> 01:50:43,430
You know, it should be artful.
But no one cares.

1601
01:50:44,931 --> 01:50:48,936
The world may mistakenly see
computers only in black and white,

1602
01:50:49,937 --> 01:50:53,858
but we live, and we dream
and we paint in color.

1603
01:50:55,526 --> 01:50:57,987
And we think
the computer should, too.

1604
01:51:04,577 --> 01:51:05,828
What do you think?

1605
01:51:11,291 --> 01:51:15,378
Jony, I always want you
to be honest with me.

1606
01:51:18,214 --> 01:51:19,674
No matter what.

1607
01:51:20,550 --> 01:51:22,762
Just be brutally honest.

1608
01:51:25,264 --> 01:51:26,557
Understand?

1609
01:51:26,974 --> 01:51:28,517
Understand.

1610
01:51:31,062 --> 01:51:32,855
What do you think?

1611
01:51:34,732 --> 01:51:37,109
I think, I think the blue,

1612
01:51:39,820 --> 01:51:40,988
it's not quite right.

1613
01:51:43,407 --> 01:51:47,119
Here's a dopey idea. What if
we put the speakers inside?

1614
01:51:49,997 --> 01:51:52,208
Yeah, Steve,
Gil Amelio and the board

1615
01:51:52,291 --> 01:51:54,461
are not gonna allow that.
No way.

1616
01:51:57,589 --> 01:52:00,217
We're not gonna
ask for permission.

1617
01:52:01,635 --> 01:52:03,595
Steve's done an admirable
job assisting me

1618
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:06,348
as an advisor during
this, this period.

1619
01:52:06,598 --> 01:52:11,395
And while I commend his
actions, and his initiatives,

1620
01:52:11,895 --> 01:52:15,190
I believe it's now in our
best interest to move on,

1621
01:52:15,357 --> 01:52:19,111
and relieve Steve of his
advisory role in this company.

1622
01:52:20,696 --> 01:52:21,697
I agree, Gil.

1623
01:52:23,281 --> 01:52:24,365
You do?

1624
01:52:24,448 --> 01:52:28,286
I do think it's time Steve step
out of his current role, yes.

1625
01:52:29,413 --> 01:52:30,414
Steve?

1626
01:52:31,081 --> 01:52:32,082
Thank you, Ed.

1627
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:37,879
I'd like to present the Board my
vision for the future of Apple.

1628
01:52:39,131 --> 01:52:41,425
We're not Microsoft or Dell.

1629
01:52:41,967 --> 01:52:44,636
So we need to stop
trying to be that.

1630
01:52:46,471 --> 01:52:51,685
We need to go back to who we
are, and what we do best,

1631
01:52:51,768 --> 01:52:54,229
and throw away
everything else.

1632
01:52:54,688 --> 01:52:55,731
Here's how
we're gonna do it.

1633
01:52:55,814 --> 01:52:57,607
We're gonna build
a new line of computers

1634
01:52:57,691 --> 01:52:59,485
for the home,
and for the office.

1635
01:53:00,319 --> 01:53:03,322
We're gonna build a new operating
system on the backbone of NEXT.

1636
01:53:04,741 --> 01:53:07,034
The next generation
of Macintosh.

1637
01:53:07,535 --> 01:53:10,329
And we're gonna kill
every other project.

1638
01:53:11,289 --> 01:53:12,415
Everything.

1639
01:53:12,498 --> 01:53:16,085
This company will not
make shit anymore.

1640
01:53:17,003 --> 01:53:19,380
We're also gonna double down
on the advertising budget.

1641
01:53:19,464 --> 01:53:22,967
Chiat Day will be the only
advertising agency we use.

1642
01:53:23,134 --> 01:53:25,094
Just like back
in the old days.

1643
01:53:25,845 --> 01:53:27,054
In short,

1644
01:53:28,347 --> 01:53:30,224
we're gonna make
Apple cool again.

1645
01:53:31,602 --> 01:53:33,729
But I will not be
able to move forward

1646
01:53:34,855 --> 01:53:39,317
without the Board's permission to
operate under complete autonomy.

1647
01:53:40,151 --> 01:53:43,988
I'll be made a full voting member
of the Board. And lastly...

1648
01:53:46,783 --> 01:53:48,367
Interim CEO.

1649
01:53:51,370 --> 01:53:52,747
Now, hold on.

1650
01:53:54,123 --> 01:53:57,126
I'm the CEO, and this is...

1651
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:01,464
Look, you put me
in this position.

1652
01:54:01,923 --> 01:54:06,303
Apple is like a ship with a hole in
the bottom, and it's leaking water.

1653
01:54:06,386 --> 01:54:08,347
And it's my job
to make sure that

1654
01:54:08,430 --> 01:54:10,516
we point the ship
in the right direction.

1655
01:54:10,599 --> 01:54:13,268
So why don't you
let me do my job?

1656
01:54:13,727 --> 01:54:15,979
All right, let's
put this to a vote.

1657
01:54:17,356 --> 01:54:18,857
Those in favor?

1658
01:54:26,865 --> 01:54:28,492
What the hell?

1659
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:30,661
Ed?

1660
01:54:32,871 --> 01:54:33,872
Mike?

1661
01:54:34,498 --> 01:54:37,460
Sorry, Gil.
Nothing personal.

1662
01:54:47,220 --> 01:54:50,014
When you grow up,
you tend to get told

1663
01:54:50,098 --> 01:54:52,891
the world is
the way that it is,

1664
01:54:53,267 --> 01:54:56,144
your life is just to live
your life inside the world

1665
01:54:56,728 --> 01:54:59,773
and try not to bash
into the walls too much.

1666
01:54:59,982 --> 01:55:02,192
But that's a very limited life.

1667
01:55:02,568 --> 01:55:04,486
Life can be much broader,

1668
01:55:04,570 --> 01:55:07,531
once you discover one simple fact.

1669
01:55:08,408 --> 01:55:10,869
And that is that everything
around you

1670
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:12,662
that you call life

1671
01:55:12,996 --> 01:55:16,165
was made up by people that
are no smarter than you.

1672
01:55:16,749 --> 01:55:19,711
And you can change it.
You can influence it.

1673
01:55:19,794 --> 01:55:23,381
You can build your own things,
that other people can use.

1674
01:55:23,464 --> 01:55:26,759
It's to shake off
this erroneous notion

1675
01:55:26,843 --> 01:55:28,261
that life is just there,

1676
01:55:28,344 --> 01:55:31,014
and you're just gonna live
in it, versus embrace it.

1677
01:55:31,097 --> 01:55:34,767
Change it. Improve it.
Make your mark upon it.

1678
01:55:34,851 --> 01:55:39,188
And once you learn that, you'll
never be the same again.

1679
01:55:41,025 --> 01:55:42,902
But in our cash position...

1680
01:55:42,985 --> 01:55:44,320
Mr. CEO.

1681
01:55:45,070 --> 01:55:46,155
Mike.

1682
01:55:46,238 --> 01:55:48,324
You wanted
to talk to me?

1683
01:55:48,449 --> 01:55:50,743
Welcome. Please.
Have a seat.

1684
01:55:51,285 --> 01:55:53,078
Ed. Hey, Gareth.

1685
01:55:53,537 --> 01:55:54,538
Mike.

1686
01:55:59,084 --> 01:56:00,210
What's this?

1687
01:56:00,836 --> 01:56:01,962
It's an opportunity.

1688
01:56:04,298 --> 01:56:06,758
I haven't seen Bernard
around for a few days.

1689
01:56:06,841 --> 01:56:09,052
Where's Katherine,
Delano?

1690
01:56:09,218 --> 01:56:12,598
Mr. Lewis and Mrs. Hudson made
a difficult decision easier

1691
01:56:13,098 --> 01:56:15,517
by agreeing to step
down from the Board.

1692
01:56:15,809 --> 01:56:16,810
Really?

1693
01:56:16,894 --> 01:56:21,065
They both agreed to accept incredibly
generous golden parachutes.

1694
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:24,944
The same opportunity is
detailed inside that envelope.

1695
01:56:25,819 --> 01:56:27,696
So you're forcing us out?

1696
01:56:28,113 --> 01:56:29,198
With good reason.

1697
01:56:29,281 --> 01:56:30,407
And what's that?

1698
01:56:30,491 --> 01:56:32,117
The current arrangement is

1699
01:56:33,577 --> 01:56:34,620
inhibiting.

1700
01:56:35,704 --> 01:56:38,290
I can't hold everyone's hand
while we cross the street, Mike.

1701
01:56:38,374 --> 01:56:41,168
And so your next big move
is to eradicate your Board?

1702
01:56:41,251 --> 01:56:42,753
And you think you
can just do that?

1703
01:56:42,836 --> 01:56:46,633
I'm sorry, Mike.
But it's time.

1704
01:56:47,550 --> 01:56:50,261
Take the parachute.
It's more than fair.

1705
01:56:58,269 --> 01:57:00,021
Twenty years.

1706
01:57:03,733 --> 01:57:05,860
You know, I told myself
I'd be out of here

1707
01:57:05,944 --> 01:57:08,029
while I was still
in my thirties.

1708
01:57:09,197 --> 01:57:13,410
And now look at me.
I'm practically an old man.

1709
01:57:22,419 --> 01:57:23,545
Gentlemen.

1710
01:57:24,295 --> 01:57:25,505
Thanks, Mike.

1711
01:57:38,810 --> 01:57:39,894
So...

1712
01:57:41,146 --> 01:57:43,481
What are we gonna do now?

1713
01:57:51,198 --> 01:57:53,868
We're gonna put
a dent in the universe.

1714
01:58:03,627 --> 01:58:04,879
Here's to the crazy ones.

1715
01:58:07,006 --> 01:58:09,008
The misfits,

1716
01:58:09,425 --> 01:58:11,010
the rebels,

1717
01:58:11,927 --> 01:58:13,637
the troublemakers,

1718
01:58:14,138 --> 01:58:16,682
the round pegs
in the square holes,

1719
01:58:17,725 --> 01:58:20,311
the ones who see
things differently.

1720
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:22,814
They're not fond of rules,

1721
01:58:23,356 --> 01:58:26,485
and they have no respect
for the status quo.

1722
01:58:28,111 --> 01:58:30,197
You can quote them,

1723
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:32,074
disagree with them,

1724
01:58:32,157 --> 01:58:34,200
glorify or vilify them.

1725
01:58:35,242 --> 01:58:36,869
About the only thing
you can't do

1726
01:58:37,536 --> 01:58:39,497
is ignore them.

1727
01:58:39,830 --> 01:58:41,540
Because they change things.

1728
01:58:42,208 --> 01:58:44,585
They push
the human race forward.

1729
01:58:46,045 --> 01:58:48,255
And while some may see
them as the crazy ones,

1730
01:58:51,342 --> 01:58:53,010
we see genius.

1731
01:58:54,178 --> 01:58:56,556
Because the people
